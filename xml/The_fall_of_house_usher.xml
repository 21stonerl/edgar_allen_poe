<content>
    <p n="1">DURING the whole of a <fos type="alliteration">dull, dark, and
            soundless</fos> day in the autumn of the year, <fos
            type="personification">when the clouds hung oppressively </fos> low in the
        heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of
        country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of
        the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was --<fos type="hyperbole">but,
            with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my
            spirit.</fos> I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of
        that <fos type="irony">half-pleasurable, because poetic,
            sentiment,</fos> with which the mind usually receives even the sternest
        natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me --upon the
        mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain --upon the bleak walls --upon
        the vacant eye-like windows --upon a few rank sedges --and upon a few white trunks of
        decayed trees --with an utter depression of soul which <fos type="simile">I can
            compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller
            upon opium</fos> --the bitter lapse into everyday life --the hideous dropping
        off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart --an unredeemed
        dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the
        sublime. What was it --I paused to think --what was it that so unnerved me in the
        contemplation of <fos type="metaphor"><fos type="symbolism">the House of
                Usher?</fos></fos> It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I
        grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall
        back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of
        very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of
        this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a
        mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture,
        would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful
        impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a
        black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down --but with
        a <fos type="onomatopoeia">shudder</fos> even more thrilling than before
        --upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and
        the vacant and eye-like windows.</p>
    <p n="2">Nevertheless, in this <fos type="imagery">mansion of
            gloom</fos> I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor,
            <char>Roderick Usher</char>, had been one of my boon
        companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however,
        had lately reached me in a distant part of the country --a letter from him --which, in its
        wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave
        evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of <fos type="hyperbole">acute
            bodily illness</fos> --of a mental disorder which oppressed him --and of an
        earnest desire to see me, <fos type="irony">as his best, and indeed his only
            personal friend</fos>, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my
        society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more,
        was said <fos type="personification">--it the apparent heart that went with his
            request --</fos>which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly
        obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.</p>
    <p n="3">Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little
        of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that
        his very ancient family had been noted, <fos type="hyperbole">time out of
            mind</fos>, for a <fos type="alliteration">peculiar
            sensibility</fos> of temperament, displaying itself, through <fos
            type="hyperbole">long ages</fos>, in many works of exalted art, and
        manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of <fos type="irony">munificent yet
            unobtrusive charity</fos>, as well as in a <fos type="alliteration"
            >passionate devotion</fos> to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the
        orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very
        remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put
        forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the
        direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so
        lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect
        keeping of the char of <fos type="personification"> premises with the
            accredited char of the people</fos>, and while speculating upon the
        possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon
        the other --it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent
        undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at
        length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and
        equivocal appellation of the <fos type="metaphor">"House of Usher"</fos>
        --an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both
        the family and the family mansion.</p>
    <p n="4">I have said that the <fos type="hyperbole">sole effect of my somewhat
            childish experiment</fos> --that of looking down within the tarn --had been to
        deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the
        rapid increase of my superstition --for why should I not so term it? --served mainly to
        accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the <fos type="irony"
            >paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis.</fos> And it
        might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house
        itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy --a fancy so
        ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which
        oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about
            <fos type="personification">the whole mansion and domain there hung an
            atmosphere peculiar to themselves</fos> and their immediate vicinity-an
        atmosphere <fos type="hyperbole">which had no affinity with the air of
            heaven</fos>, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray
        wall, and the silent tarn --a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly
        discernible, and leaden-hued.</p>
    <p n="5"><fos type="hyperbole">Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a
            dream</fos>, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.
            <fos type="hyperbole">Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive
            antiquity.</fos> The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi
        overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves.
            <fos type="irony">Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary
            dilapidation</fos>. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared
        to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling
        condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious
        totality of old wood-work <fos type="simile">which has rotted for long years in
            some neglected vault</fos>, with no disturbance from the breath of the
        external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, <fos
            type="personification">the fabric gave little token of instability.</fos>
        Perhaps <fos type="metaphor">the eye of a scrutinising <char
                >observer</char></fos> might have discovered a barely perceptible
        fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall
        in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the <fos type="onomatopoeia">sullen
            waters of <fos type="symbolism">the
        tarn.</fos></fos></p>
    <p n="6">Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in
        waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy
        step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my
        progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know
        not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects
        around me --while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon
        blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which <fos
            type="onomatopoeia">rattled as I strode</fos>, were but matters to which, or
        to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy --while I hesitated not to
        acknowledge how familiar was all this --I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the
        fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the
        physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low
        cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw
        open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.</p>
    <p n="7"><fos type="imagery">The room in which I found myself was very large and
            lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the
            black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within.</fos>
        <fos type="imagery">Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light</fos> made their
        way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more
        prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of
        the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. <fos
            type="imagery">Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,
            comfortless, antique, and tattered.</fos>
        <fos type="imagery">Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but
            failed to give any vitality to the scene.</fos>
        <fos type="personification">I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.</fos>
        <fos type="symbolism">An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and
            pervaded all.</fos></p>
    <p n="8">Upon my entrance, <char>Usher</char> arose from a sofa on
        which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a <fos
            type="hyperbole">vivacious warmth</fos> which had much in it, I at first
        thought, of an <fos type="irony">overdone cordiality</fos> --of the
        constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance,
        convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke
        not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. <fos
            type="metaphor">Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period,
            as had Roderick Usher!</fos> It was with difficulty that I could bring myself
        to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.
            <fos type="imagery">Yet the char of his face had been at all times
            remarkable.</fos> A <fos type="imagery">cadaverousness of
            complexion</fos>; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips
        somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate
        Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded
        chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than
        web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the
        regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.</p>
    <p n="9">In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an <fos
            type="alliteration">incoherence --an inconsistency</fos>; and I soon found
        this to arise from a series of feeble and futile <fos type="alliteration"
            >struggles</fos> to overcome an habitual trepidancy --an excessive nervous
        agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter,
        than by <fos type="imagery">reminiscences of certain boyish
        traits</fos>, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation
        and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and
            sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a <fos type="metaphor"
            >tremulous indecision</fos> (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in
        abeyance) to that species of energetic concision --that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and
        hollow-sounding enunciation --that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural
        utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium,
        during the periods of his most intense excitement.</p>
    <p n="10">It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see
        me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he
        conceived to be the nature of his malady.</p>
    <p n="11">It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he
        despaired to find a remedy --a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would
        undoubtedly soon pass off.</p>
    <p n="12">He suffered much from a <fos type="hyperbole">morbid acuteness of the
            senses</fos>; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only
        garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were
        tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed
        instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.</p>
    <p n="13">To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. <fos
            type="hyperbole">"I shall perish,"</fos> said he, <fos
            type="hyperbole">"I must perish in this deplorable folly."</fos>
        <fos type="metaphor">"Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be
            lost."</fos></p>
    <p n="14">I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I
        shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this
        intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its
        absolute effect --in terror.</p>
    <p n="15"> In this <fos type="personification">unnerved-in this pitiable
            condition</fos> --I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I
        must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm,
            <fos type="symbolism">FEAR.</fos>
    </p>
    <p n="16">I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints,
        another singular feature of his mental condition. He was <fos type="personification"
            >enchained</fos> by certain <fos type ="symbolism">superstitious impressions</fos> in
        regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured
        forth --in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too
        shadowy here to be re-stated --an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and
        substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his
        spirit-an effect which the <fos type ="imagery">physique of the gray walls and turrets</fos>, and of
        the <fos type ="symbolism">dim tarn</fos> into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought
        about upon the morale of his existence.</p>
    <p n="17">He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom
        which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more <fos type ="hyperbole">natural and far more palpable
            origin</fos> -- to the severe and long-continued illness -- indeed to the
        evidently approaching <fos type ="hyperbole">dissolution</fos> of a tenderly beloved <char
            >sister</char> -- his sole companion for long years -- his
        last and only relative on earth. <quote>"Her decease,"</quote> he said, with a
        bitterness which I can never forget, "would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the
        last of the ancient race of the Ushers." While he spoke, the <char
            >lady Madeline</char> (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote
        portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded
        her with an utter <fos type ="imagery">astonishment not unmingled with dread</fos> --and yet I found
        it impossible to account for such feelings. <fos type ="imagery">A sensation of stupor oppressed
            me</fos>, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed
        upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother --but he
        had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary
        wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate
        tears.</p>
    <p n="18">The disease of the <char>lady
            Madeline</char> had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy,
        a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a
        partially cataleptical char, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily
        borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed;
        but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she <fos
            type="personification">succumbed</fos> (as her brother told me at night with
            <fos type="imagery">inexpressible agitation</fos>) to the
            <fos type="symbolism">prostrating power of the destroyer</fos>; and
        I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I
        should obtain -- that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.</p>
    <p n="19">For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either<char
           >Usher</char> or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest
            <fos type="imagery">endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my
            friend</fos>. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream,
        to the wild improvisations of his <fos type="metaphor">speaking
            guitar.</fos> And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more
        unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility
        of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality,
        poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in <fos
            type="hyperbole">one unceasing radiation of gloom.</fos></p>
    <p n="20"><fos type="imagery">I shall ever bear about me a memory</fos>
        of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of <fos
            type="symbolism">the House of Usher.</fos> Yet I should fail in any attempt to
        convey an idea of the exact char of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he
        involved me, or led me the way.</p>
    <p n="21"> An <fos type="imagery">excited and highly distempered
            ideality</fos> threw a <fos type="imagery">sulphureous
            lustre</fos> over all. His <fos type="imagery">long improvised
            dirges</fos> will <fos type="hyperbole">ring forever in my
            ears</fos>. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular
        perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of <char
            >Von Weber.</char> From the paintings over which his elaborate
        fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the
        more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; --from these paintings (vivid as
        their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion
        which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the
        nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an
        idea, that mortal was <char>Roderick Usher.</char> For me at
        least --in the circumstances then surrounding me --there arose out of the pure abstractions
        which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe,
        no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too
        concrete reveries of Fuseli.</p>
    <p n="22">One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of
        the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. <fos
            type="imagery">A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and
            rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or
            device.</fos> Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the
        idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No
        outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial
        source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and
            <fos type="imagery">bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate
            splendour.</fos></p>
    <p n="23">I have just spoken of that <fos type="hyperbole">morbid
            condition</fos> of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to
            <char>the sufferer,</char> with the exception of certain
        effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus
        confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the <fos
            type="symbolism">fantastic char of his performances</fos>. But the fervid
        facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in
        the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently
        accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental
        collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in
        particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these
        rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as
        he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I
        perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the
        tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled "The Haunted
        Palace," ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:</p>
    <rhapsodie> I. In the greenest of our valleys, By good angels tenanted, Once fair and stately
        palace -- <fos type="imagery">Radiant palace</fos> --reared its head. In
        the monarch Thought's dominion -- It stood there! Never seraph spread a opinion Over fabric
        half so fair. II. Banners yellow, glorious, golden, On its roof did float and flow; (This
        --all this --was in the olden Time long ago) And every <fos type="personification"
            >gentle air that dallied,</fos> In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed
        and pallid, A winged odour went away. III. Wanderers in that <fos
            type="personification">happy valley</fos> Through two luminous windows saw
        Spirits moving musically To a lute's well-tuned law, Round about a throne, where sitting
        (Porphyrogene!) In state his glory well befitting, The ruler of the realm was seen. IV. And
        all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing,
        flowing, flowing And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing,
        In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king. V. But evil things, in
        robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch's high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow
        Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and
        bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed. VI. And travellers now
        within that valley, Through the red-litten windows, see Vast forms that move fantastically
        To a discordant melody; While, like a rapid ghastly river, Through the pale door, A hideous
        throng rush out forever, And laugh --but smile no more. </rhapsodie>
    <p n="24"> I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of
        thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of <char
            >Usher's</char> which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for
        other men have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it.
        This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But,
        in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring char, and trespassed, under
        certain conditions, upon the <fos type="symbolism">kingdom of
            inorganization.</fos> I lack words to express the full extent, or the
            <fos type="hyperbole">earnest abandon of his persuasion.</fos> The
        belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the
        home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined,
        fulfilled in the method of <fos type="imagery">collocation of these stones --in
            the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread
            them, and of the decayed trees which stood around --above all, in the long undisturbed
            endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the
            tarn.</fos>
        <quote>Its evidence --the evidence of the sentience --was to be seen,he said, (and I
            here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of
            their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable,</quote> he added,
        in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the
        destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him --what he was. Such opinions
        need no comment, and I will make none.</p>
    <p n="25">Our books --the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental
        existence of the invalid --were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this
            <fos type="metaphor">char of phantasm.</fos> We pored together
        over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the
        Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the
        Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indagine, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the
        Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favourite volume was a
        small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne;
        and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and AEgipans, over
        which <fos type="hyperbole">Usher would sit dreaming for hours.</fos>
        His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book
        in quarto Gothic --the manual of a forgotten church --the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum
        Ecclesiae Maguntinae.</p>
    <p n="26">I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable
        influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the
            <char>lady Madeline</char> was no more, he stated
        his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment,)
        in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason,
        however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to
        dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the
        unusual char of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on
        the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of
        the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the
        person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, <fos
            type="irony">I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by
            no means an unnatural, precaution.</fos></p>
    <p n="27">At the request of <char>Usher</char>, I personally aided
        him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we
        two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long
        unopened that our torches, half smothered in its <fos type="personification"
            >oppressive atmosphere,</fos> gave us little opportunity for investigation)
        was <fos type="imagery">small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for
            light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which
            was my own sleeping apartment.</fos> It had been used, apparently, in remote
        feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of
        deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,
        and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully
        sheathed with copper. <fos type="imagery">The door, of massive iron, had been,
            also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound,
            as it moved upon its hinges.</fos></p>
    <p n="28">
        <fos type="metaphor"><fos type="personification">Having deposited our
                mournful burden upon tressels within this region of
            horror,</fos></fos> we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid
        of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the
        brother and sister now first <fos type="metaphor">arrested my
            attention</fos>; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some
        few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that
        sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances,
        however, rested not long upon the dead --for we could not regard her unawed. <fos
            type="metaphor">The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth,
            had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical char,</fos>
        <fos type="personification">the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the
            face</fos>, and that <fos type="hyperbole">suspiciously lingering
            smile</fos> upon the lip which is so terrible in death. <fos
            type="imagery">We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of
            iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper
            portion of the house. </fos></p>
    <p n="29">And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over
        the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His
        ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. <fos type="hyperbole">He roamed
            from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.</fos> The
        pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue --but the
        luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. <fos type="imagery">The once
            occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of
            extreme terror, habitually charized his utterance.</fos> There were
        times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some
        oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. <fos
            type="hyperbole">At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere
            inexplicable vagaries of madness,</fos> for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy
        for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some
        imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me. I felt
        creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet
        impressive superstitions.</p>
    <p n="30">It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or
        eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the
        full power of such feelings. <fos type="personification">Sleep came not near my
            couch --while the hours waned and waned away.</fos> I struggled to reason off
        the <fos type="personification">nervousness which had dominion over
            me.</fos> I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was
        due to the bewildering influence of the <fos type="personification">gloomy
            furniture</fos> of the room --of the dark and tattered draperies, which,
        <fos type="personification">tortured into motion</fos> by the breath
        of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about
        the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. <fos type="metaphor">An
            irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame;</fos> and, at length, there
        sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp
        and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the
        intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened --I know not why, except that an instinctive
        spirit prompted me --to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of
        the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of
        horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I
        should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable
        condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the
        apartment.</p>
    <p n="31">I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining
        staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of <char
           >Usher.</char><fos type="imagery"> In an instant afterward he
            rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.</fos>
        His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan --but, moreover, <fos
            type="hyperbole">there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes --an evidently
            restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.</fos> His air appalled me --but
        anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his
        presence as a relief.</p>
    <p n="32"><quote>And you have not seen it?" he said abruptly, after having stared
            about him for some moments in silence --"you have not then seen it? --but, stay! you
            shall." Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the
            casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.</quote></p>
    <p n="33">The <fos type="hyperbole">impetuous furyof the entering gust nearly
            lifted us from our feet.</fos>
        <fos type="imagery">It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and
            one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty.</fos> A whirlwind had
        apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and <fos
            type="personification">violent alterations in the direction of the wind;</fos>
        and the <fos type="imagery">exceeding density of the clouds</fos> (which
        hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the
        life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other,
        without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not
        prevent our perceiving this --yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars --nor was there any
        flashing forth of the lightning. But the under surfaces of the huge masses of <fos
            type="personification">agitated vapour,</fos><fos type="hyperbole">
            as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural
            light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about
            and enshrouded the mansion.</fos></p>
    <p n="34">
        <quote>You must not --you shall not behold this!" said I, shudderingly, to
                <char>Usher</char>, as I led him, with a gentle violence,
            from the window to a seat. "These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical
            phenomena not uncommon --or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank
            miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement; --the air is chilling and dangerous to
            your frame. Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen;
            --and so we will pass away this terrible night together."</quote></p>
    <p n="35">The antique volume which I had taken up was the <quote>Mad Trist"</quote>
        of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of <char
            >Usher's</char> more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in
        its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and
        spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I
        indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find
        relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the
        extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by <fos type ="personification">
        the wild over-strained air</fos> of vivacity with which
        he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have
        congratulated myself upon the success of my design.</p>
    <p n="36">I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where <char>Ethelred,</char> the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain
        for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance
        by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:</p>
    <p n="37">
        <quote>"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a <fos type="metaphor">doughty
                heart</fos>, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness
            of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold <fos
                type="symbolism">parley with the hermit,</fos> who, in sooth, was of an
            obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the
            rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in
            the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily,
            he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, <fos type="imagery">that the
                noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the
                forest."</fos></quote></p>
    <p n="38">At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it
        appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) --it
        appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, <fos
            type="hyperbole">there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have
            been,</fos> in its exact similarity of char, the echo (but a stifled and
        dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which <char>Sir Launcelot</char> had so particularly described. It
        was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had <fos type="metaphor">arrested
            my attention</fos>; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and
        the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had
        nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:</p>
    <p n="39">
        <quote>"But the good champion <char
                >Ethelred</char>, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed
            to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, <fos
                type="imagery">a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue,
                which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the
                wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend</fos> enwritten
            --</quote></p>
    <p n="40">Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin; Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he
        shall win.</p>
    <p n="41"><quote>And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the
            dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and
            harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands
            against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before
        heard."</quote></p>
    <p n="42">Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement --for
        there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from
        what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but
        harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound --the exact counterpart of
        what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the
        romancer.</p>
    <p n="43">Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most
        extraordinary coincidence, by <fos type="hyperbole">a thousand conflicting
            sensations,</fos> in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still
        retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive
        nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in
        question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken
        place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his
        chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially
        perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring
        inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast --yet I knew that he was not asleep, from
        the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of
        his body, too, was at variance with this idea --for he rocked from side to side with a
        gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the
        narrative of <char>Sir Launcelot</char>, which thus
        proceeded:</p>
    <p n="44">
        <quote>"And now, <fos type="imagery">the champion, having escaped from the
                terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the
                breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of
                the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle
                to where the shield was upon the wall</fos>; which in sooth tarried not
            for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty
            great and terrible ringing sound."</quote></p>
    <p n="45">No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than --as if a shield of brass had
        indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver, <fos type="imagery">
            became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled
            reverberation.</fos> Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the
        measured rocking movement of <char>Usher</char> was undisturbed. I
        rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout
        his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his
        shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about
        his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious
        of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his
        words.</p>
    <p n="46">
        <quote>"Not hear it? --yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long --long --long --many

            not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her

        syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul --<quote>MADMAN! I TELL

        <fos type="hyperbole">As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had
            been found the potency of a spell</fos> --the huge antique panels to which the

    <p n="48">From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was still
        abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot
        along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have
