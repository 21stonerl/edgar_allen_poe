    <p n="1"> I CANNOT, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I first
        became acquainted with the <char ref="lady Ligeia">lady Ligeia</char> . Long years have since
        elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring
        these points to mind, because, in truth, the char of my beloved, her rare learning, her
        singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and <fos type="alliteration">enthralling eloquence </fos><fos type="personification">of her low
        musical language</fos>, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily
        progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. <fos type="imagery">Yet I believe that I met her first
        and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine.</fos> Of her family --I have
        surely heard her speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. <char ref="lady Ligeia">
            Ligeia </char>! <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char>! in studies of a nature more than
        all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone
        --by <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char> --that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of
        her who is no more. <fos type="irony">And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never
        known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who became the
        partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom.</fos> Was it a playful charge on the part
        of my <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char>? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I
        should institute no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own --<fos type="metaphor">a
        wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion?</fos> I but indistinctly
        recall the fact itself --what wonder that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances which
        originated or attended it? And, indeed, if ever she, the wan and<fos type="personification"> the misty-winged Ashtophet
        of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell,<fos type="irony"> over marriages ill-omened,</fos> then most surely she
        presided over mine.</fos></p>
    <p n="2"> There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is the
        person of <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char>. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and,
        in her latter days, even emaciated. <fos type="imagery">I would <fos type="hyperbole">in vain attempt</fos> to portray the majesty, the
        quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her
        footfall.</fos> <fos type="simile">She came and departed as a shadow.</fos> I was never made aware of her entrance into my
        closed study save by the <fos type="personification">dear music of her low sweet voice</fos>, as she placed her marble hand
        upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. <fos type="imagery"><fos type="metaphor">It was the radiance of an
        opium-dream </fos>--an airy and spirit-lifting vision <fos type="hyperbole">more wildly divine</fos> than the phantasies which
        hovered vision about the <fos type="alliteration">slumbering souls </fos>of the daughters of Delos.</fos> Yet her features were
        not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical
        labors of the heathen. <quote> "There is no exquisite beauty," says Bacon, Lord Verulam,
            speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty, without some strangeness in the
            proportion." Yet, although I saw that the features of <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char>
            were not of a classic regularity --although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed
                <quote>"exquisite,"</quote> and felt that there was much of
              <fos type="personification">  <quote>"strangeness"</quote> pervading it</fos>, yet I have tried in vain to detect the
            irregularity and to trace home my own perception of <quote>"the strange."</quote> I
            examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead --it was faultless --<fos type="hyperbole">how cold indeed
            that word when applied to a majesty so divine</fos>! --<fos type="metaphor"><fos type="imagery">the skin rivalling the purest ivory,</fos></fos>
            the commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above the
            temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling
            tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet, "hyacinthine!" </quote><fos type="imagery">I
        looked at the delicate outlines of the nose --and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of
        the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection.</fos> There were the same luxurious smoothness of
        surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same<fos type="personification"> harmoniously
        curved nostrils speaking the free spirit.</fos> I regarded the<fos type="imagery"> sweet mouth.</fos> Here was indeed the
        triumph of all things heavenly --<fos type="imagery"><fos type="hyperbole">the magnificent turn of the short upper lip</fos></fos> --the soft,
        voluptuous slumber of the under --the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke --the
        teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which
        fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. I
        scrutinized the formation of the chin --and here, too, <fos type="imagery">I found the gentleness of breadth,
        the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek --<fos type="metaphor">the contour
        which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian.</fos></fos> And
        then I peered into the large eyes of <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char>. </p>
    <p n="3">For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been, too,
        that in these eves of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I
        must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race. <fos type="simile">They were even fuller than
        the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad.</fos> Yet it was only at
        intervals --in moments of intense excitement --that this peculiarity became more than
        slightly noticeable in <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char>. <fos type="imagery">And at such moments was her beauty
        --in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps --the beauty of beings either above or apart
        from the earth --the beauty of the fabulous Houri of the Turk.</fos><fos type="imagery"> The hue of the orbs was the
        most<fos type="alliteration"> brilliant of black,</fos> and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length</fos>. The brows,
        slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The <quote> "strangeness,"
        </quote>however, which I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation, or
        the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to the
        expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our
        ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia
        </char>! How for long hours have I pondered upon it!<fos type="hyperbole"> How have I, through the whole of a
        midsummer night, struggled to fathom it!</fos> <fos type="imagery">What was it --that something more profound than the
        well of Democritus --which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? What was it? I was
        possessed with a passion to discover.</fos> <fos type="hyperbole">Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine
        orbs!</fos> <fos type="metaphor">they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.</fos> </p>
    <p n="4">There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of
        mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact --never, I believe, noticed in the schools
        --that, in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often find
        ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember.
        <fos type="imagery"> And thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia </char>'s eyes,
        have I felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression --felt it approaching --yet
        not quite be mine --and so at length entirely depart</fos>! <fos type="metaphor">And (strange, oh strangest mystery of
        all!) I found, in the commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to theat
        expression. </fos><fos type="metaphor">I mean to say that, subsequently to the period when <char ref="lady Ligeia"> Ligeia's
        </char> beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from
        many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt always aroused within me
        by her large and luminous orbs.</fos> Yet not the more could I define that sentiment, or analyze,
        or even steadily view it. <fos type="imagery">I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a
        rapidly-growing vine --in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of
        running water. I have felt it in the ocean; in the falling of a meteor. <fos type="personification"> I have felt it in
        the glances of unusually aged people.</fos></fos> <fos type="imagery">And there are one or two stars in heaven --(one
        especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large
        star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the feeling.</fos> <fos type="imagery"><fos type="personification">I
        have been filled with it </fos>by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently
        by passages from books.</fos> Among innumerable other instances, I well remember something in a
        volume of <char ref="Joseph Glanvill">Joseph Glanvill</char>, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness --who shall say?) never
        failed to inspire me with the sentiment; --<quote>"And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who
        knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all
        things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death
        utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will." </quote></p>
    <p n="5">Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace, indeed,
        some remote connection between this passage in the English moralist and a portion of the
        char of <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char>. <fos type="imagery">An intensity in thought, action, or speech,
        was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which,
        during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more immediate <fos type="personification">evidence of its
        existence.</fos> </fos><fos type="metaphor">Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid
            <char ref="lady Ligeia
                "> Ligeia </char>, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous
        vultures of stern passion.</fos> And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the
        miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me --by the
        almost <fos type="alliteration">magical melody, modulation,</fos> distinctness and placidity of her very low voice --and by
        the <fos type="imagery">fierce energy</fos> (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of
        the <fos type="alliteration">wild words</fos> which she habitually uttered.</p>
        <p n="6"> <fos type="imagery">I have spoken of the learning of <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char>: it was
        immense --such as I have never known in woman</fos>. <fos type="imagery">In the classical tongues was she deeply
        proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of
        Europe, <fos type="hyperbole">I have never known her at fault.</fos> </fos>Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because
        simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy, have I ever found
            <char ref="lady Ligeia
                "> Ligeia </char> at fault? How singularly --how thrillingly, this one
        point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my
        attention! I said her knowledge was such as I have never known in woman --but where breathes
        the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral, physical, and
        mathematical science? <fos type="imagery">I saw not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of
            <char ref="lady Ligeia
                "> Ligeia </char> were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently
        aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her
        guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily
        occupied during the earlier years of our marriage.</fos> <fos type="imagery">With how vast a triumph --with how vivid
        a delight --with how much of all that is ethereal in hope --did I feel, as she bent over me
        in studies but little sought --but less known --that delicious vista by slow degrees
        expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at length
        pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!</fos></p>
    <p n="7"> <fos type="personification">How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years, I
        beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away! </fos><fos type="simile">Without
            <char ref="lady Ligeia
                "> Ligeia </char> I was but as a child groping benighted.</fos> <fos type="personification">Her presence,
        her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in
        which we were immersed.</fos> <fos type="simile">Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden,
        grew duller than Saturnian lead</fos>. And now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the
        pages over which I pored. <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char> grew ill. <fos type="metaphor">The wild eyes blazed
        with a too --too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue
        of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with
        the tides of the gentle emotion. </fos><fos type="metaphor">I saw that she must die --and I struggled desperately in
        spirit with the grim Azrael.</fos> And the struggles of the passionate wife were, to my
        astonishment, even more energetic than my own.<fos type="metaphor"> There had been much in her stern nature to
        impress me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors; --but
        not so.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">Words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with
        which she wrestled with the Shadow. </fos><fos type="imagery">I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle.</fos> <fos type="imagery">I would
        have soothed --I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life,
        --for life --but for life --solace and reason were the uttermost folly. </fos><fos type="personification">Yet not until the
        last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the
        external placidity of her demeanor. </fos><fos type="imagery">Her voice grew more gentle --grew more low --yet I would
        not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. </fos><fos type="personification">My brain reeled as I
        hearkened entranced, to a melody more than mortal --to assumptions and aspirations which
        mortality had never before known</fos>.</p>
    <p n="8"> That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been easily
        aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary passion. But in
        death only, was I fully impressed with the strength of her affection. <fos type="metaphor">For long hours,
        detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than
        passionate devotion amounted to idolatry.</fos> <fos type="personification">How had I deserved to be so blessed by such
        confessions? --how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour
        of her making them, But upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Let me say only, that in
            <char ref="lady Ligeia
                "> Ligeia's </char> more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all
        unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the principle of her longing with
        so wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away.</fos> <fos type="personification">It is this
        wild longing --it is this eager vehemence of desire for life --but for life --that I have no
        power to portray --no utterance capable of expressing.</fos> </p>
    <p n="9">At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily, to
        her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before. I
        obeyed her. --They were these:</p>
    <p n="10"><fos type="imagery"> Lo! 'tis a gala night Within the lonesome latter years! </fos><fos type="metaphor">An angel throng,
        bewinged, bedight In veils, and drowned in tears, Sit in a theatre, to see A play of hopes
        and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully The music of the spheres</fos>.</p>
    <p n="11"> <fos type="personification">Mimes, in the form of God on high, Mutter and mumble low, And hither and
        thither fly -- Mere puppets they, who come and go At bidding of vast formless things That
        shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings Invisible Wo! </fos></p>
    <p n="12"> <fos type="imagery">That motley drama! --oh, be sure It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom
        chased forever more, By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in
        To the self-same spot, And much of Madness and more of Sin And Horror the soul of the
        plot.</fos></p>
    <p n="13"> <fos type="personification">But see, amid the mimic rout, A crawling shape intrude! </fos>A blood-red thing
        that writhes from out The <fos type="alliteration">scenic solitude!</fos><fos type="metaphor">It writhes! --it writhes! --with mortal pangs The
        mimes become its food, And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs In human gore imbued.</fos></p>
    <p n="14"> <fos type="metaphor">Out --out are the lights --out all! And over each quivering form, The curtain, a
        funeral pall, Comes down with the rush of a storm, And the angels, all pallid and wan,
        Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, <quote>"Man,"</quote> And its hero the Conqueror
        Worm.</fos></p>
    <p n="15">
        <quote> "O God!" </quote>half shrieked <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char>, leaping to her feet
        and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines --<fos type="imagery"><quote>"O
        God! O Divine Father! --shall these things be undeviatingly so? --shall this Conqueror be
        not once conquered? Are we not part and parcel in Thee? Who --who knoweth the mysteries of

        only through the weakness of his feeble will."</quote></fos></p>
    <p n="16"> And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall,
        and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her last sighs, there came
        mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear and distinguished,
        again, the concluding words of the passage in Glanvill --<fos type="personification"><quote>"Man doth not yield him to the
        angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will." </quote></fos></p>
    <p n="17">She died; --and I, <fos type="metaphor">crushed into the very dust with sorrow,</fos> could no longer
        endure the lonely <fos type="alliteration">desolation of my dwelling in the <fos type="personification">dim and decaying</fos>city by the Rhine.</fos> I had
        no lack of what the world calls wealth. <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char> had brought me far
        more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months,
        therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey,
        which I shall not name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair
            England.<fos type="imagery"> The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost
            savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories
        connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had
        driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. </fos>Yet although the external
        abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I gave way,
        with a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to
        a display of more than regal magnificence within. --<fos type="simile">For such follies, even in childhood, I
        had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Alas, I feel
        how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic
        draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the
        Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! </fos><fos type="symbolism">I had become a bounden slave in the trammels
        of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. </fos>But these
        absurdities must not pause to detail. <fos type="metaphor">Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed,
        whither in a moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride --as the
        successor of the unforgotten <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char> --the fair-haired and blue-eyed

    <p n="18"> <fos type="imagery">There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that
            <fos type="metaphor">bridal chamber</fos> which is not now visibly before me. Where were
        the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted
        to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? </fos><fos type="imagery">I
        have said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber --yet I am sadly forgetful on
        topics of deep moment --and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic display,
        to take hold upon the memory.</fos> The room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was
        pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size.<fos type="personification"> Occupying the whole southern face of the
        pentagon was the sole window --an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice --a single
        pane, and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing
        through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within.</fos> Over the upper portion of this
        huge window, extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls
        of the turret. <fos type="imagery">The ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and
        elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic,
        semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting,
        depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the same metal,
        Saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out
        of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored
        fires</fos></p>
    <p n="19">. <fos type="symbolism">Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in various
        stations about --and there was the couch, too --bridal couch --of an Indian model, and low,
        and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above.</fos> <fos type="imagery">In each of the angles of the
        chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings
        over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of
        the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. </fos><fos type="hyperbole">The lofty walls, gigantic in height
        --even unproportionably so --were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and
        massive-looking tapestry --tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the
        floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the
        gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the
        richest cloth of gold. </fos>It was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque
        figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty
        black. But these figures partook of the true char of the arabesque only when regarded
        from a single point of view. <fos type="personification">By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very
        remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one entering the room,
        they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this
        appearance gradually departed; and step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the
        chamber, he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which
        belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk. The
        phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong
        continual current of wind behind the draperies --giving a hideous and uneasy animation to
        the whole.</fos></p>
    <p n="20"> <fos type="imagery">In halls such as these --in a <fos type="metaphor">bridal chamber</fos> such
        as this --I passed, with the <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Lady of Tremaine</char>, the unhallowed hours
        of the first month of our marriage --passed them with but little disquietude. That my wife
        dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper --that she shunned me and loved me but little --I
        could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. </fos><fos type="hyperbole">I loathed her with
        a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity
        of regret!) to <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char>, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the
        entombed.</fos> I revelled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her
        ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love.<fos type="imagery"> Now, then, did my spirit fully and
        freely burn with more than all the fires of her own.</fos> <fos type="personification">In the excitement of my opium dreams
        (for I was habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her
        name, during the silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day,
        as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my longing for
        the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned --ah, could it be
        forever? --upon the earth</fos>.</p>
        <p n="21"><fos type="imagery"> About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">
            Lady Rowena</char> was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was
        slow.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of
        half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the turret,
        which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the
        phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">She became at length convalescent --finally
        well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder again threw her
        upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never
        altogether recovered.</fos> <fos type="foreshadowing">Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming char, and of
        more alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her
        physicians. With the increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken too
        sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe
        a similar increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by
        trivial causes of fear. </fos>She spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the
        sounds --of the slight sounds --and of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which
        she had formerly alluded. </p>
    <p n="22"><fos type="foreshadowing">One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressing
        subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She had just awakened from an
        unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague
        terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. </fos>I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon
        one of the ottomans of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of
        sounds which she then heard, but which I could not hear --of motions which she then saw, but
        which I could not perceive. <fos type="personification">The wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I
        wished to show her (what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those almost
        inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were
        but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind.</fos> <fos type="foreshadowing">But a deadly pallor,
        overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be
        fruitless.</fos> She appeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call. I remembered
        where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and
        hastened across the chamber to procure it. <fos type="imagery">But, as I stepped beneath the light of the
        censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention.</fos> <fos type="imagery">I had felt that some
        palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I saw that there lay
        upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a
        shadow --a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect --such as might be fancied for the
        shadow of a shade. </fos><fos type="hyperbole">But I was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and
            heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char>.</fos> Having
        found the wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the
        lips of the fainting <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">lady</char>. She had now partially recovered, however,
        and took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened
        upon her person. <fos type="foreshadowing">It was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the
            carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char> was
        in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall
        within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or
        four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid.</fos> If this I saw --not so
        <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char>. <fos type="imagery">She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forbore to
        speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have been but the
        suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the
            <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">lady</char>, by the opium, and by the hour.</fos></p>
    <p n="23"> <fos type="imagery">Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent
        to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my
        wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the
        tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber
        which had received her as my bride</fos>. --<fos type="metaphor">Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like,
        before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the
        varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the
        censer overhead.</fos> <fos type="imagery">My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a former night,
        to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had seen the faint traces of the shadow.</fos>
       <fos type="personification"> It was there, however, no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to
        the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. </fos><fos type="imagery">Then rushed upon me a thousand memories of
            <char ref="lady Ligeia
                "> Ligeia </char> --and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent
        violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which I had regarded her thus
        enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only
        and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the body of <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char>.</fos> </p>
    <p n="24">It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken no
        note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me from my revery. --I
        felt that it came from the bed of ebony --the bed of death. I listened in an agony of
        superstitious terror --but there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision to
        detect any motion in the corpse --but there was not the slightest perceptible. Yet I could
        not have been deceived. I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened
        within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. <fos type="personification"> Many
        minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At
        length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable tinge of color
        had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids</fos>. <fos type="imagery">Through a
        species of unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no
        sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where
        I sat.</fos> <fos type="personification">Yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. </fos>I could no longer
        doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations --that <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char>
        still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was
        altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants --there were none
        within call --I had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many
        minutes --and this I could not venture to do. <fos type="metaphor">I therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to
        call back the spirit ill hovering.</fos> <fos type="simile">In a short period it was certain, however, that a relapse
        had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even
        more than that of marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly
        expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of
        the body; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately supervened. </fos><fos type="imagery">I fell back with a
        shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself
        up to passionate waking visions of <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char>.</fos> </p>
    <p n="25"><fos type="personification">An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second time aware of
        some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I listened --in extremity of horror.</fos>
        The sound came again --it was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I saw --distinctly saw --a
        tremor upon the lips.<fos type="metaphor"> In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the
        pearly teeth.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto
        reigned there alone. </fos><fos type="metaphor">I felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was
        only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty
        thus once more had pointed out.</fos> <fos type="alliteration">There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the
        cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was even a slight
        pulsation at the heart. </fos>The <char ref="lady Ligeia
            ">lady</char> lived; and with redoubled ardor I
        betook myself to the task of restoration. <fos type="personification">I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and
        used every exertion which experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. But in
        vain. Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the
        dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the
        livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of
        that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.</fos> </p>
        <p n="26"> And again I sunk into visions of <char ref="lady Ligeia
            "> Ligeia </char> --and again,
        (what marvel that I shudder while I write,) again there reached my ears a low sob from the
        region of the ebony bed.<fos type="imagery"> But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that
        night? Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray
        dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only
        into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a
        struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I know not what of
        wild change in the personal appearance of the corpse?</fos> Let me hurry to a conclusion. </p>
    <p n="27"> <fos type="hyperbole">The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been
        dead, once again stirred --and now more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a
        dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any.</fos> <fos type="personification">I had long ceased to struggle
        or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of
        violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming.</fos>
        <fos type="imagery">The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before. The hues of life flushed
        up with unwonted energy into the countenance --the limbs relaxed --and, save that the
        eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the grave
        still imparted their charnel char to the figure, I might have dreamed that
            <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char> had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of Death. </fos><fos type="metaphor">But
        if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when,
        arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of
        one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into
        the middle of the apartment.</fos> </p>
    <p n="28"><fos type="personification">I trembled not --I stirred not --for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected
        with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing hurriedly through my brain,
        had paralyzed --had chilled me into stone.</fos> <fos type="alliteration">I stirred not --but gazed upon the apparition.
        There was a mad disorder in my thoughts --a tumult unappeasable.</fos> Could it, indeed, be the
        living <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char> who confronted me? Could it indeed be
        <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Rowena</char> at all --the fair-haired, the blue-eyed <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Lady
            Rowena</char> Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why should I doubt it? The bandage lay
        heavily about the mouth --but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing
        <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Lady of Tremaine</char>?<fos type="imagery">And the cheeks-there were the roses as in her
            noon of life --yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living <char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">Lady of

            hers? --but had she then grown taller since her ma<char ref=" Lady Rowena Trevanion">lady</char>? What
        inexpressible madness seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her feet!</fos>
        <fos type="simile">Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which
        had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber, huge
        masses of long and dishevelled hair; it was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight!</fos>
        And now slowly opened the eyes of the figure which stood before me. <quote> "Here then, at
            least," </quote>I shrieked aloud, <quote>"can I never --can I never be mistaken --these
