        <p n="1"> Nil sapientiae odiosius acumine nimio. - Seneca. </p>
        <p n="2"> At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I was enjoying
            the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend <char
                ref="C. Auguste Dupin">C. Auguste Dupin</char>, in his little back library, or
            book-closet, au troisieme, No. 33, Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at
            least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might
            have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that
            oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing
            certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period
            of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the
            murder of <char ref="Marie Roget">Marie Roget</char>. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a
            coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old
            acquaintance, <char ref="Monsieur G--">Monsieur G--</char>, the Prefect of the Parisian police. </p>
        <p n="3"> We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the
            entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several
            years. We had been sitting in the dark, and <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char> now arose for the purpose
            of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon <char ref="Monsieur G--">G.</char>â€™s saying
            that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some
            official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble. </p>
        <p n="4">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"If it is any point requiring reflection,"</conversation>
            observed <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>, as he forbore to enkindle the wick, <conversation
                speaker="Dupin">"we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"That is another of your odd notions,"</conversation>
            said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling every thing "odd" that was beyond his
            comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of "oddities." </p>
        <p n="6">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Very true,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>, as he
            supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable chair. </p>
        <p n="7">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"And what is the difficulty now?"</conversation> I
            asked. <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Nothing more in the assassination way, I
                hope?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="8">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the
                business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it
                sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                    ">Dupin</char> would like to
                hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="9">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Simple and odd,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>. </p>
        <p n="10">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we
                have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles
                us altogether."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="11">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts
                you at fault,"</conversation> said my friend. </p>
        <p n="12">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"What nonsense you do talk!"</conversation> replied the
            Prefect, laughing heartily. </p>
        <p n="13">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Perhaps the mystery is a little too
                plain,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                    ">Dupin</char>. </p>
        <p n="14">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an
                idea?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="15">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"A little too self-evident."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="16">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Ha! ha! ha! --ha! ha! ha! --ho! ho! ho!"</conversation>
            --roared our visitor, profoundly amused, <conversation speaker="Prefect">"oh,
                <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                    ">Dupin</char>, you will be the death of me yet!"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="17">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"And what, after all, is the matter on
                hand?"</conversation> I asked. </p>
        <p n="18">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Why, I will tell you,"</conversation> replied
            <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled
            himself in his chair. <conversation speaker="Prefect">"I will tell you in a few words;
                but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the
                greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were
                it known that I confided it to any one."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="19">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Proceed,"</conversation> said I. </p>
        <p n="20">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Or not,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>. </p>
        <p n="21">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Well, then; I have received personal information, from
                a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been
                purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; this
                beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also, that it still remains in
                his possession."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="22">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"How is this known?"</conversation> asked
            <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>. </p>
        <p n="23">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"It is clearly inferred,"</conversation> replied
            <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>, <conversation speaker="Prefect">"from the nature of the
                document, and from the nonappearance of certain results which would at once arise
                from its passing out of the robber's possession; --that is to say, from his
                employing it as he must design in the end to employ it."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="24">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Be a little more explicit,"</conversation> I said. </p>
        <p n="25">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper
                gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely
                valuable."</conversation>
            <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> was fond of the cant of diplomacy. </p>
        <p n="26">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Still I do not quite understand,"</conversation> said
            <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>. </p>
        <p n="27">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third
                person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of
                most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy
                over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so
                jeopardized."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="28">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But this ascendancy,"</conversation> I interposed,
                <conversation speaker="Narrator">"would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the
                loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare--"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="29">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"The thief,"</conversation> said <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>,
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"is the Minister <char ref="D--">D--</char>, who dares all
                things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft
                was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question --a letter, to be frank
                --had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During
                its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted
                personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and
                vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was,
                upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed,
                the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister <char ref="D--">D--</char>.
                His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of the
                address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret.
                After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he
                produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to
                read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses,
                for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he
                takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner
                saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the
                third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own
                letter --one of no importance --upon the table."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="30">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Here, then,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char> to
            me, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"you have precisely what you demand to make the
                ascendancy complete --the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the
                robber."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="31">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Yes,"</conversation> replied <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>;
                <conversation speaker="Prefect">"and the power thus attained has, for some months
                past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The
                personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of
                reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven
                to despair, she has committed the matter to me."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="32">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Than whom,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>, amid
            a perfect whirlwind of smoke, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"no more sagacious agent
                could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="33">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"You flatter me,"</conversation> replied
            <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>; <conversation speaker="Prefect">"but it is possible that some
                such opinion may have been entertained."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="34">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"It is clear,"</conversation> said I, <conversation
                speaker="Narrator">"as you observe, that the letter is still in possession of the
                minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which
                bestows the power. With the employment the power departs."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="35">
            <conversation speaker="G">"True,"</conversation> said <char ref="Monsieur G--
                ">G.</char>
            <conversation speaker="G">"and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to
                make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in
                the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been
                warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our
                design."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="36">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But,"</conversation> said I, <conversation
                speaker="Narrator">"you are quite au fait in these investigations. The Parisian
                police have done this thing often before."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="37">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Oh yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of
                the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all
                night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their
                master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have
                keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three
                months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been
                engaged, personally, in ransacking the <char ref="D--">D-- </char>Hotel. My honor is
                interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not
                abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more
                astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of
                the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be
                concealed."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="38">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But is it not possible,"</conversation> I suggested,
                <conversation speaker="Narrator">"that although the letter may be in possession of
                the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon
                his own premises?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="39">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"This is barely possible,"</conversation> said
            <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The present peculiar condition of
                    affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which <char ref="D--">D--</char> is
                known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document --its
                susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice --a point of nearly equal
                importance with its possession."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="40">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Its susceptibility of being produced?"</conversation>
            said I. </p>
        <p n="41">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"That is to say, of being destroyed,"</conversation> said
            <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>. </p>
        <p n="42">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"True,"</conversation> I observed; <conversation
                speaker="Narrator">"the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for its being
                upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the
                question."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="43">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Entirely,"</conversation> said <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>.
                <conversation speaker="Prefect">"He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and
                his person rigorously searched under my own inspection."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="44">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"You might have spared yourself this
                trouble,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                    ">Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="Dupin"
                        >"<char ref="D--">D--</char>, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have
                anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="45">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Not altogether a fool,"</conversation> said <char ref="Monsieur G--
                ">G.</char>,
                <conversation speaker="G">"but then he's a poet, which I take to be only one remove
                from a fool."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="46">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"True,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>, after a
            long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"although I
                have been guilty of certain doggerel myself."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="47">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Suppose you detail,"</conversation> said I,
                <conversation speaker="Narrator">"the particulars of your search."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="48">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched
                everywhere. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building,
                room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the
                furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know
                that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is
                impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a
                search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk --of
                space --to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The
                fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs.
                The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the
                tables we removed the tops."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="49">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Why so?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="50">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged
                piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the
                leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. The
                bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="51">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But could not the cavity be detected by
                sounding?"</conversation> I asked. </p>
        <p n="52">
            <conversation speaker="G">"By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient
                wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to
                proceed without noise."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="53">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But you could not have removed --you could not have
                taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to
                make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin
                spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and
                in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not
                take to pieces all the chairs?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="54">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Certainly not; but we did better --we examined the rungs of
                every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of
                furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of
                recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain
                of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in
                the glueing --any unusual gaping in the joints --would have sufficed to insure
                detection."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="55">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the
                boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the
                curtains and carpets."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="56">
            <conversation speaker="G">"That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every
                particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided
                its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be
                missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises,
                including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as
                before."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="57">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"The two houses adjoining!"</conversation> I exclaimed;

        <p n="60">
            <conversation speaker="G">"All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us
                comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it

        </p>
        <p n="61">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You looked among <char ref="D--">D--</char>'s papers, of course,

        </p>
        <p n="62">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only
                opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting
                ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police
                officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate
                admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had
                any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly
                impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes,
                just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the
                needles."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="63">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You explored the floors beneath the

        <p n="64">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the

        <p n="65">

            producing a memorandum-book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal,

        <p n="75"> In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very

        </p>
        <p n="89"> I was astounded. The <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> appeared absolutely thunderstricken.
            For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my
            friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then,
            apparently in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares,
            finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the
            table to <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his
            pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the
            <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened
            it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and
            struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the
            house, without having uttered a syllable since <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char> had requested him to
            fill up the check. </p>
        <p n="90"> When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations. </p>
        <p n="91">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The Parisian police,"</conversation> he said,
                <conversation speaker="Dupin">"are exceedingly able in their way. They are
                persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their
                duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when <char ref="Monsieur G--

                    of searching the premises at the Hotel <char ref="D--">D--</char>, I felt entire confidence in
                his having made a satisfactory investigation --so far as his labors

        </p>
        <p n="92">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"So far as his labors extended?"</conversation> said I. </p>

                <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The measures adopted were not only the best of their
                kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within
                the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found
                it."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="94"> I merely laughed --but he seemed quite serious in all that he said. </p>
        <p n="95">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The measures, then,"</conversation> he continued,
                <conversation speaker="Dupin">"were good in their kind, and well executed; their
                defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man. A certain set of
                highly ingenious resources are, with the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>, a sort of Procrustean
                bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too
                deep or too shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better
                reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in
                the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and
                is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and
                demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the
                guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the
                marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in
                mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example,
                an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are
                they even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the second
                trial he wins, for he then says to himself, the simpleton had them even upon the
                first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd
                upon the second; I will therefore guess odd'; --he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with
                a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow
                finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose
                to himself upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the
                first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a
                variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will
                therefore guess even' guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the
                schoolboy, whom his fellows termed "</conversation>lucky,<conversation
                speaker="Dupin">" --what, in its last analysis, is it?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="96">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"It is merely,"</conversation> I said, <conversation
                speaker="Narrator">"an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his
                opponent."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="97">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"It is,"</conversation> said <char ref="C. Auguste Dupin
                ">Dupin</char>;
                <conversation speaker="Dupin">"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he
                effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received
                answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or
                how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the
                expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression
                of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart,
                as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy
                lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to
                    <char ref="Rochefoucauld">Rochefoucauld</char>, to <char ref="La Bougive">La Bougive</char>, to

        </p>
        <p n="98">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"And the identification,"</conversation> I said,
                <conversation speaker="Narrator">"of the reasoner's intellect with that of his
                opponent, depends, if I understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the

        </p>
        <p n="99">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"For its practical value it depends upon

                    ">Dupin</char>; <conversation speaker="Dupin">"and
                        the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> and his cohort fall so frequently, first, by default of
                this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through
                non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only
                their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to
                the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much --that
                their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the
                cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon
                foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very
                usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their
                investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency --by some
                extraordinary reward --they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice,
                without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of
                        <char ref="D--">D--</char>, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all
                this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and
                dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches --what is it all
                but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of
                search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to
                which the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>, in the long routine of his duty, has been
                accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to
                conceal a letter, --not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg --but, at
                least, in some hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would
                urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not
                see also, that such recherches nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary
                occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of
                concealment, a disposal of the article concealed --a disposal of it in this
                recherche manner, --is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and
                thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere
                care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of
                importance --or, what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes, when the
                reward is of magnitude, --the qualities in question have never been known to fall.
                You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter
                been hidden anywhere within the limits of the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>'s examination
                --in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the
                principles of the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> --its discovery would have been a matter
                altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly
                mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the
                Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets;
                this the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio

                the popular error to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its
                promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have
                insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the
                originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance --if
                words derive any value from applicability --then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra' about
                as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,' 'religio' religion or 'homines

            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that
                reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I
                dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are
                the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to
                observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the
                truths of what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this
                error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has
                been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of
                relation --of form and quantity --is often grossly false in regard to morals, for
                example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts
                are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of
                motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a
                value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other
                mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the
                mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an
                absolutely general applicability --as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant,
                in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says
                that 'although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves
                continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.' With the
                algebraists, however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed,
                and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an
                unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere
                mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not
                clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and
                unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if
                you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not
                altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his
                reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you
                down."</conversation>

                    <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> would have been under no necessity of giving me this check.
                I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to
                his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew
                him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could
                not fall to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have
                failed to anticipate --and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate
                --the waylayings to which he was subjected. His frequent absences from home at
                night, which were hailed by the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> as certain aids to his success,
                I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police,
                and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which <char ref="Monsieur G--

                in fact, did finally arrive --the conviction that the letter was not upon the
                premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains
                in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action
                in searches for articles concealed --I felt that this whole train of thought would
                necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to
                despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak
                as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as
                open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the
                microscopes of the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as
                a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of
                choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> laughed
                when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery

                as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the vis inertiae, for
                example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in
                the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller
                one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it
                is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more
                constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet
                the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few
                steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs,

            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"There is a game of puzzles,"</conversation> he resumed,
                <conversation speaker="Dupin">"which is played upon a map. One party playing
                requires another to find a given word --the name of town, river, state or empire
                --any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice
                in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most
                minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large
                characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely
                lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being
                excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the
                moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those
                considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is
                a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the
                    <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char>. He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the
                Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world,
                by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving

                within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search --the more satisfied I became

                ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece. In this
                rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a
                solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two,
                across the middle --as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as
                worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal,
                bearing the <char ref="D--">D--</char> cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a
                diminutive female hand, to <char ref="D--">D--</char>, the minister, himself. It was thrust
                carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the upper divisions
                of the rack."</conversation>

            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded
                it to be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,
                radically different from the one of which the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> had read us so
                minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the <char ref="D--">D--</char>
                cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the <char ref="S--">S--</char>
                family. Here, the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the
                superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the
                size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of these
                differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the
                paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of <char ref="D--">D--</char>, and so
                suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of
                the document; these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this
                document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the
                conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly
                corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to

                which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention
                really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its
                external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a
                discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In
                scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed
                necessary. They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff
                paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed
                direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This
                discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a
                glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the <char ref="Minister">Minister</char> good
                morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the

                however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows
                of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of
                a mob. <char ref="D--">D--</char> rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the

                not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and

                ">Dupin</char>, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"is a desperate man, and a man of
                nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I
                made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence
                alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object
                apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this
                matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the
                    <char ref="Minister">Minister</char> has had her in his power. She has now him in hers; since,
                being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his
                exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his
                political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward.
                It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of
                climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come
                down. In the present instance I have no sympathy --at least no pity --for him who
                descends. He is the monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess,
                however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts,
                when, being defied by her whom the <char ref="Prefect">Prefect</char> terms 'a certain personage,'
                he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the
                card-rack."</conversation>

                interior blank --that would have been insulting. <char ref="D--">D--</char>, at Vienna once,
                did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember.
                So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person
                who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is well
                acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the
                words--"</conversation>
