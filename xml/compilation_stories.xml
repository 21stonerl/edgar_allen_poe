        <p n="1">
            WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the <char>old man</char> seemed too much exhausted to speak.</p>
        
        <p n="2">  <conversation speaker="old_man"> "Not long ago,"</conversation> said he at length,<conversation speaker="old_man"> "and I could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons ; but, about three years past, there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man -- or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of -- and the six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a very old man -- but I am not. It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy ?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="3">  The "little cliff," upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge -- this "little cliff" arose, <fos type="imagery">a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us</fos>. Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at the sky -- while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.</p>
        
        <p n="4">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"You must get over these fancies,"</conversation> said the <char>guide</char>, <conversation speaker="Guide">"for I have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event I mentioned -- and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye."
        </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="old_man"> "We are now,"</conversation> he continued, in that particularizing manner which distinguished him -- <conversation speaker="Guide">"we are now close upon the Norwegian coast -- in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude -- in the great province of Nordland -- and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher -- hold on to the grass if you feel giddy -- so -- and look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="5">  I looked dizzily, and beheld <fos type="imagery"> a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue</fos> as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's account of the Mare Tenebrarum. A panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, <fos type="imagery">as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world,</fos> lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by <fos type="personification">the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever.</fos> Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and <fos type="imagery">at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island ; or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="6">  The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction -- as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.</p>
        
        <p n="7">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"The island in the distance,"</conversation> resumed the old man, <conversation speaker="old_man">"is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off -- between Moskoe and Vurrgh -- are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the places -- but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything ? Do you see any change in the water ?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="8">  We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of <fos type="simile">a loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie;</fos> and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed -- to its headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury ; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. <fos type="imagery">Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion -- heaving, boiling, hissing -- gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.
        </fos>
            In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical alteration.<fos type="imagery"> The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before.</fos>
            <fos type="personification"> These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast. </fos>Suddenly -- very suddenly -- this assumed a distinct and definite existence, <fos type="imagery">in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray ; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar,</fos> 
            <fos type="metaphor">such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="9">  The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation.</p>
        
        <p n="10">  <conversation speaker="Narrator">"This,"</conversation> said I at length, to the old man -- <conversation speaker="Narrator">"this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstr�m."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="11"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"So it is sometimes termed,"</conversation> said he. "<conversation speaker="old_man">We Norwegians call it the Moskoe-str�m, from the island of Moskoe in the midway."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="12">  The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene -- or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time ; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.</p>
        
        <p n="13">  <conversation speaker="old_man"> "Between Lofoden and Moskoe,"</conversation> he says, "<conversation speaker="old_man">the depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms ; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity ; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts ; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks ; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea -- it being constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground."
        </conversation>
            In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The "forty fathoms" must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-str�m must be immeasurably greater ; and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of the line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.</p>
        
        <p n="14">  The attempts to account for the phenomenon -- some of which, I remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal -- now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands, "have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, <fos type="simile">which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract</fos> ; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments." -- These are the words of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelstr�m is an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part -- the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented ; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it ; and here I agreed with him -- for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.</p>
        
        <p n="15">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"You have had a good look at the whirl now,"</conversation> said the old man, <conversation speaker="old_man">"and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-str�m."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="16">  I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.</p>
        
        <p n="17"> <conversation speaker="old_man">Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater abundance ; so that we often got in a single day, what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation -- the risk of life standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="18"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this ; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the Moskoe-str�m, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming -- one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return -- and we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here ; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents -- here to-day and gone to-morrow -- which drove us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="19"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered 'on the grounds' -- it is a bad spot to be in, even in good weather -- but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the Moskoe-str�m itself without accident ; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing -- but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger -- for, after all is said and done, it was a horrible danger, and that is the truth.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="20"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18__, a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget -- for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="21"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"The three of us -- my two brothers and myself -- had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven, by my watch, when we weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Str�m at slack water, which we knew would be at eight.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="22"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most unusual -- something that had never happened to us before -- and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="23"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us -- in less than two the sky was entirely overcast -- and what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="24"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us ; but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off -- the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="25"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the Str�m, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once -- for we lay entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this -- which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done -- for I was too much flurried to think.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="27">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard -- but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror -- for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word 'Moskoe-str�m'!</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="28"> <conversation speaker="old_man"> "No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well enough -- I knew what he wished to make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Str�m, and nothing could save us!</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="29">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"You perceive that in crossing the Str�m channel, we always went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack -- but now we were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this ! 'To be sure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack -- there is some little hope in that' -- but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="30">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear sky -- as clear as I ever saw -- and of a deep bright blue -- and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness -- but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="31">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother -- but, in some manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his finger, as if to say 'listen'!</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="32">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"At first I could not make out what he meant -- but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean. It had run down at seven o'clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Str�m was in full fury!</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="33"> <conversation speaker="old_man"> "When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from beneath her -- which appears very strange to a landsman -- and this is what is called riding, in sea phrase. Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly ; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose -- up -- up -- as if into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quick glance around -- and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Str�m whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead -- but no more like the every-day Moskoe-Str�m, <fos type="simile">than the whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race.</fos> If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognised the place at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="34">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. <fos type="simile">The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt.</fos> At the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek -- such a sound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl ; and I thought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the abyss -- down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, <fos type="simile">but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge.</fos> Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left. <fos type="simile">It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.
        </fos>
            "It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strung my nerves</conversation>.</p>
        
        <p n="35">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"It may look like boasting -- but what I tell you is truth -- I began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power. I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind. After a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself. I positively felt a wish to explore its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make ; and my principal grief was that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy a man's mind in such extremity -- and I have often thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little light-headed.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="36">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"There was another circumstance which tended to restore my self-possession ; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not reach us in our present situation -- for, as you saw yourself,<fos type="imagery"> the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge.</fos> If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these annoyances -- just us death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="37">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act -- although I knew he was a madman when he did it -- a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all ; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty in doing ; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even keel -- only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="38">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds I dared not open them -- while I expected instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased ; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="39"> <conversation speaker="old_man"> "Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with which I gazed about me. <fos type="simile">The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic,</fos> midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.
        </conversation></p>
        
        <p n="40">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately. The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward. In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She was quite upon an even keel -- that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water -- but this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level ; and this, I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="41"> <conversation speaker="old_man"> "The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf ; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, <fos type="simile">and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity.</fos> This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom -- but the yell that went up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="42">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had carried us a great distance down the slope ; but our farther descent was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept -- not with any uniform movement -- but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards -- sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="43">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our company. I must have been delirious -- for I even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I found myself at one time saying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears,' -- and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length, after making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all -- this fact -- the fact of my invariable miscalculation -- set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="44"> <conversation speaker="old_man"> "It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more exciting hope. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-str�m. By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way -- so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters -- but then I distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbed -- that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was, that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their descent -- the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other of any other shape, the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere -- the third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master of the district ; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to me -- although I have forgotten the explanation -- how what I observed was, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments -- and showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.* </conversation></p>
        
        <p n="45"><conversation speaker="old_man">"There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little from their original station.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="46">  <conversation speaker="old_man">"I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design -- but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay ; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="47"> <conversation speaker="old_man">"The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myself who now tell you this tale -- as you see that I did escape -- and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say -- I will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep. The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. <fos type="imagery">By degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west,</fos> when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-str�m had been. It was the hour of the slack -- but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Str�m, and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen. A boat picked me up -- exhausted from fatigue -- and (now that the danger was removed) conversationless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions -- but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. <fos type="imagery">My hair which had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see it now.</fos> They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed. I told them my story -- they did not believe it. I now tell it to you -- and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden."</conversation>

        <p n="1">
            <fos type="metaphor">MISERY is manifold.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">The wretchedness of earth is multiform.</fos> 
            <fos type="simile">Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues of that arch,
            </fos> --as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness? --from the covenant of peace a simile of sorrow? But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to-day, or the agonies which are have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been.</p>
        
        <p n="2">My baptismal name is <char>Egaeus</char>; that of my family I will not mention. Yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray, hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and in many striking particulars --in the character of the family mansion --<fos type="imagery">in the frescos of the chief saloon --in the tapestries of the dormitories --in the chiselling of some buttresses in</fos> the armory --but more especially in the gallery of antique paintings --in the fashion of the library chamber --and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library's contents, there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief.</p>
        
        <p n="3">The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber, and with its volumes --of which latter I will say no more. Here died my mother. <fos type="metaphor">Herein was I born.</fos> But it is mere idleness to say that I had not lived before --that the soul has no previous existence. You deny it? --let us not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to convince. There is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms --of spiritual and meaning eyes --of sounds, musical yet sad --a remembrance which will not be excluded;
            <fos type="simile"> a memory like a shadow, vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady; and like a shadow, too,</fos> in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason shall exist.</p>
        
        <p n="4">In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from 
            <fos type="metaphor">the long night of what seemed, but was not, nonentity,</fos> at once into the very regions of fairy-land --into <fos type="metaphor">a palace of imagination</fos> --into the wild dominions of monastic thought and erudition --it is not singular that I gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye --that I loitered away my boyhood in books, and dissipated my youth in reverie; but it is singular that as years rolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers --it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my life --wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought. <fos type="personification">The realities of the world affected me as visions, and as visions only,</fos> while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became, in turn, --not the material of my every-day existence-but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself.</p>
        
        <p n="5"><char>Berenice</char> and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal halls. Yet differently we grew --I ill of health, and <fos type="metaphor">buried in gloom</fos> --she agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers the ramble on the hill-side --mine the studies of the cloister --I living within my own heart, and addicted body and soul to the most intense and painful meditation --she roaming carelessly through life with no thought of 
            <fos type="metaphor">the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours.</fos> 
            <conversation speaker="Egaeus">Berenice! --I call upon her name --Berenice</conversation>! --and from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound! 
            <conversation speaker="Egaeus">Ah! vividly is her image before me now, as in the early days of her light-heartedness and joy! Oh! gorgeous yet fantastic beauty! Oh! sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! --Oh! Naiad among its fountains!</conversation> --and then --then all is mystery and terror, and a tale which should not be told. Disease --a fatal disease --fell like the simoom upon her frame, and, even while I gazed upon her, 
            <fos type="metaphor">the spirit of change swept, over her,
            </fos> pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a manner the most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of her person! Alas! the destroyer came and went, and the victim --where was she, I knew her not --or knew her no longer as Berenice.</p>
        
        <p n="6">Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itself --trance very nearly resembling positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery was in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my own disease --for I have been told that I should call it by no other appelation --my own disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form --hourly and momently gaining vigor --and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it, consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive. It is more than probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.</p>
        
        <p n="7">To muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin, or in the topography of a book; to become absorbed for the better part of a summer's day, in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry, or upon the door; to lose myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat monotonously some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in; --such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.</p>
        
        <p n="8">Yet let me not be misapprehended. --The undue, earnest, and morbid attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination. It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme condition or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually not frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight of this object <fos type="metaphor">in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions</fos> issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury, he finds the incitamentum or first cause of his musings entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case the primary object was invariably frivolous, although assuming, through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance. Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations were never pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In a word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as I have said before, the attentive, and are, with the day-dreamer, the speculative.</p>
        
        <p n="9">My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative and inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the disorder itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of the noble Italian Coelius Secundus Curio 
            <quote>"de Amplitudine Beati Regni dei";</quote> St. Austin's great work, the "City of God"; and Tertullian "de Carne Christi," in which the paradoxical sentence 
            <quote>"Mortuus est Dei filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum est quia impossibile est"</quote> occupied my undivided time, for many weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation.</p>
        
        <p n="10">Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial things,<fos type="metaphor"> my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by Ptolemy Hephestion,</fos> which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And although, to a careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the moral condition of Berenice, would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble in explaining, yet such was not in any degree the case. In the lucid intervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and, taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I did not fall to ponder frequently and bitterly upon the wonder-working means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of my disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own character, <fos type="personification">my disorder revelled</fos> in the less important but more startling changes wrought in the physical frame of Berenice --in the singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity.</p>
        
        <p n="11">During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with me, had never been of the heart, and my passions always were of the mind. Through the gray of the early morning --among the trellised shadows of the forest at noonday --and in the silence of my library at night, she had flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her --not as the living and breathing Berenice, but as <fos type="metaphor">the Berenice of a dream</fos> --not as a being of the earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being-not as a thing to admire, but to analyze --not as an object of love, but as the theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And now --now <fos type="imagery">I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition,</fos> I called to mind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her of marriage.</p>
        
        <p n="12">And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon an afternoon in the winter of the year, --one of those unseasonably warm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon*, --I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of the library. But uplifting my eyes I saw that Berenice stood before me.</p>
        
        <p n="13">*For as Jove, during the winter season, gives twice seven days of warmth, men have called this clement and temperate time the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon --Simonides.</p>
        
        <p n="14">
            <conversation speaker="Egaeus">Was it my own excited imagination --or the misty influence of the atmosphere --or the uncertain twilight of the chamber --or the gray draperies which fell around her figure --that caused in it so vacillating and indistinct an outline?</conversation> I could not tell. She spoke no word, I --not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. <fos type="personification">An icy chill ran through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul;</fos> and sinking back upon the chair, I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige of the former being, lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning glances at length fell upon the face.</p>
        
        <p n="15">The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow temples with innumerable ringlets now of a vivid yellow, and Jarring discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholy of the countenance. <fos type="imagery">The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, and seemingly pupil-less, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a smile of peculiar meaning,</fos> 
            <fos type="personification">the teeth of the changed Berenice disclosed themselves slowly to my view.</fos> 
            <conversation speaker="Egaeus">Would to God that I had never beheld them, or that, having done so, I had died!</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="16">The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamber of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away, the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth. Not a speck on their surface --not a shade on their enamel --not an indenture in their edges --but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory. I saw them now even more unequivocally than I beheld them then. The teeth! --the teeth! --they were here, and there, and everywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and excessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them,
            <fos type="simile"> as in the very moment of their first terrible development.</fos> Then came the full fury of my monomania, and I struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of the external world I had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied desire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single contemplation. They --they alone were present to the mental eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mad'selle Salle it has been well said, <quote>"que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments,"</quote> and of Berenice I more seriously believed que toutes ses dents etaient des idees. Des idees! --ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me! Des idees! --ah therefore it was that I coveted them so madly! I felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace, in giving me back to reason.</p>
        
        <p n="17">And the evening closed in upon me thus-and then the darkness came, and tarried, and went --and the day again dawned --and the mists of a second night were now gathering around --and still I sat motionless in that solitary room; and still I sat buried in meditation, and still the phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy as, with the most vivid hideous distinctness, it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause, succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many low moanings of sorrow, or of pain. I arose from my seat and, throwing open one of the doors of the library, saw standing out in the antechamber a servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was --no more. She had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, 
            <fos type="personification">the grave was ready for its tenant</fos>, and all the preparations for the burial were completed.</p>
        
        <p n="18">I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream. I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware that since the setting of the sun Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary period which intervened I had no positive --at least no definite comprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror --horror more horrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, 
            <fos type="simile">like the spirit of a departed sound,</fos> the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears. I had done a deed --what was it? I asked myself the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered me, "what was it?"</p>
        
        <p n="19">On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. It was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, for it was the property of the family physician; but how came it there, upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were in no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words were the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat, 
            <quote>"Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas."</quote> Why then, as I perused them, did 
            <fos type="personification">the hairs of my head erect themselves on end,</fos> and the blood of my body become congealed within my veins?</p>
        
        <p n="20">There came a light tap at the library door, and 
            <fos type="simile">pale as the tenant of a tomb,</fos> a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror, and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What said he? --some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night --of the gathering together of the household-of a search in the direction of the sound; --and then his tones grew thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave --of a disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing, still palpitating, still alive!</p>
        
        <p n="21">He pointed to garments;-they were muddy and clotted with gore. I spoke not, and he took me gently by the hand; --it was indented with the impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some object against the wall; --I looked at it for some minutes; --it was a spade. With a shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it. But I could not force it open; and in my tremor <fos type="imagery">it slipped from my hands, and fell heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound, there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered to and fro about the floor.</fos></p>

        <p n="1">    
            <fos type="metaphor">I AM come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion.</fos> Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence -- whether much that is glorious- whether all that is profound -- does not spring from disease of thought -- from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate, however, 
            <fos type="simile">rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the "light ineffable," and again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer,</fos> <quote> "agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="2">We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence -- the condition of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life -- and a condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.</p>
        
        <p n="3">She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed. <char>Eleonora</char> was the name of my cousin. We had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in 
            <fos type="metaphor">the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.</fos> No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the valley -- I, and my cousin, and her mother.</p>
        
        <p n="4">From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it <fos type="personification">the "River of Silence"; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.</fos> No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old station, shining on gloriously forever.</p>
        
        <p n="5"><fos type="imagery">The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom, -- these spots, not less than the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the ruby-red asphodel,</fos> <fos type="imagery">that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="6"><fos type="simile">And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley.</fos> Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.</p>
        
        <p n="7">Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other's embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at our images therein. We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things.
            <fos type="imagery"> Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And life arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us. The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus-sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora.</fos> And now, too, a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within 
            <fos type="metaphor">a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.</fos> <!-- This metaphor describes the valley as a place of both beauty and confinement, suggesting that while it offers splendor, it also limits freedom. --></p>
        
        <p n="8">
            <fos type="simile">The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim;</fos> 
            <fos type="simile">but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers.</fos> <!-- This compares Eleonora’s life to the short lifespan of flowers, underscoring her innocence and the fragility of life.--> No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein.</p>
        
        <p n="9">At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive variation of phrase.</p>
        
        <p n="10">
            <fos type="simile">She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom -- that, like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die;</fos> but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the 
            <fos type="metaphor">River of Silence.</fos> <!--This metaphor implies a deeper meaning of peace and tranquility, suggesting that the river’s flow symbolizes a serene yet profound existence.--> She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of Earth -- that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow. 
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">And the curse which I invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here.</conversation> And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made easy to her the bed of her death. 
            <conversation speaker="Eleonora">And she said to me, not many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.</conversation> And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.</p>
        
        <p n="11">Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Times path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But let me on. -- Years dragged themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. 
            <fos type="personification">The star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more.</fos> The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of Aeolus, and more divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.</p>
        
        <p n="12">Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when my heart beat heavily,<fos type="personification"> the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; </fos>and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and once -- oh, but once only! <fos type="simile">I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death,</fos>
            <fos type="personification"> by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.
            </fos>
            But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length the valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.</p>
        
        <p n="13">I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women, bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations they ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once -- at whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde? -- Oh, bright was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for none other. -- Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them -- and of her.</p>
        
        <p n="14">I wedded; -- nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness was not visited upon me. And once -- but once again in the silence of the night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Sleep in peace! -- for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora."</conversation> </p>

        <year>(published 1849)</year>
        
    </info>
    <p n="1"><fos type="metaphor">I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the<char> king </char>
        was.</fos> He seemed to live only for joking.<fos type="personification"> To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell
        it well, was the surest road to his favor. </fos>Thus it happened that his seven ministers were
        all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They all took after the<char> king
        </char>, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers.
        Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which
        predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a
        lean joker is a rara avis in terris. </p>
    <p n="2"><fos type="metaphor">About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of wit, the<char> king
        </char> troubled himself very little. </fos>He had an especial admiration for breadth in a
        jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it. Over-niceties wearied him. He
        would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the 'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole,
        practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones. </p>
    <p n="3"><fos type="metaphor">At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of
        fashion at court. Several of the great continental 'powers' still retain their 'fools,' who
        wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp
        witticisms, at a moment's notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal
        table.</fos> </p>
    <p n="4"><fos type="metaphor">Our<char> king </char>, as a matter of course, retained his 'fool.' The
        fact is, he required something in the way of folly -- if only to counterbalance the heavy
        wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers -- not to mention himself.</fos> </p>
    <p n="5">His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value was trebled
        in the eyes of the<char> king </char>, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a
        cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would
        have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than
        elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.<fos type="metaphor"> But, as I have
        already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and
        unwieldy -- so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our<char> king
        </char> that, in <char> Hop-Frog </char> (this was the fool's name), he
        possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.</fos> </p>
    <p n="6">I believe the name '<char> Hop-Frog </char>' was not that given to the
        dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the
        several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. <fos type="metaphor">In fact, <char>
            Hop-Frog </char> could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait -- something
        between a leap and a wriggle -- a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of
        course consolation, to the<char> king </char>, for (notwithstanding the
        protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the<char> king
        </char>, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure.</fos> </p>
    <p n="7"><fos type="personification">But although <char> Hop-Frog </char>, through the distortion of his legs,
        could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious
        muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation
        for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity,
        where trees or ropes were in question, or any thing else to climb. </fos><fos type="simile">At such exercises he
        certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.</fos> </p>
    <p n="8">I am not able to say, with precision, from what country
            <char>Hop-Frog</char> originally came. <fos type="hyperbole">It was from some barbarous region,
        however, that no person ever heard of -- a vast distance from the court of our<char>
            king .</char></fos> <char>Hop-Frog</char>, and a young girl very little less
        dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been
        forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as
        presents to the<char> king </char>, by one of his ever-victorious generals. </p>
    <p n="9">Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose
        between the two little captives.<fos type="metaphor"> Indeed, they soon became sworn friends.</fos><char>
            Hop-Frog</char>, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means
        popular, had it not in his power to render <char>Trippetta</char> many services;
        but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was universally
        admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever
        she could, for the benefit of <char>Hop-Frog</char>. </p>
    <p n="10">On some grand state occasion -- I forgot what -- the<char> king </char>
        determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,
        occurred at our court, then the talents, both of <char>Hop-Frog </char>and
            <char>Trippetta</char> were sure to be called into play.
          <fos type="imagery">  <char>Hop-Frog</char>, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up
        pageants, suggesting novel chars, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that
        nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.</fos> </p>
    <p n="11">The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been fitted up,
        under <char> Trippetta's</char> eye, with every kind of device which could
        possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of expectation. As for
        costumes and chars, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on
        such points. Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or
        even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere --
        except in the case of the<char> king </char> and his seven minsters. Why they
        hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found
        it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. <fos type="metaphor">At all events, time flew;
        and, as a last resort they sent for <char>Trippetta</char> and
            <char>Hop-Frog.</char> </fos></p>
    <p n="12"><fos type="imagery">When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the<char> king </char>
        they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the
        monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor</fos>. He knew that <char>Hop-Frog</char> was
        not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no
        comfortable feeling. But the<char> king </char> loved his practical jokes, and
        took pleasure in forcing <char>Hop-Frog</char> to drink and (as the<char>
            king </char> called it) 'to be merry.' </p>
    <p n="13"><quote>"Come here, <char>Hop-Frog,</char>"</quote> said he, as the jester
        and his friend entered the room; <quote> "swallow this bumper to the health of your absent
            friends, [here <char>Hop-Frog</char> sighed,] and then let us
            have the benefit of your invention. We want chars -- chars, man -- something
            novel -- out of the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness.<fos type="metaphor"> Come, drink! the
            wine will brighten your wits</fos>." </quote></p>
    <p n="14"><char>Hop-Frog</char> endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to
        these advances from the<char> king </char>; but the effort was too much. <fos type="metaphor">It
        happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his 'absent friends'
        forced the tears to his eyes.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it,
        humbly, from the hand of the tyrant</fos>. </p>
    <p n="15"><quote> "Ah! ha! ha!" </quote>roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the
        beaker. -- <quote> "See what a glass of good wine can do!<fos type="personification"> Why, your eyes are shining
            already!"</fos> </quote></p>
    <p n="16"><fos type="personification">Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone;</fos><fos type="imagery"> for the effect of wine on his
        excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He placed the goblet nervously on
        the table, and looked round upon the company with a half -- insane stare.</fos> They all seemed
        highly amused at the success of the<char> king's </char> 'joke.' </p>
    <p n="17"><quote> "And now to business," </quote>said the prime minister, a very fat man. </p>
    <p n="18"><quote> "Yes," </quote>said the <char>King</char>; <quote> <fos type="metaphor">"Come lend us
            your assistance. chars, my fine fellow; we stand in need of chars -- all of us
            -- ha! ha! ha!"</fos> </quote>and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was
        chorused by the seven. </p>
    <p n="19"><char>Hop-Frog </char>also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly. </p>
    <p n="20"><quote> "Come, come," </quote>said the<char> king </char>, impatiently,
            <quote> "have you nothing to suggest?" </quote></p>
    <p n="21"><quote> "I am endeavoring to think of something novel," </quote>replied the dwarf,
        abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. </p>
    <p n="22"><quote> "Endeavoring!" </quote>cried the tyrant, fiercely; <quote> "what do you mean
            by that? Ah, I perceive. You are Sulky, and want more wine. Here, drink this!"
        </quote>and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely
        gazed at it, gasping for breath. </p>

    <p n="23"><quote> "Drink, I say!" </quote>shouted the monster, <quote> "or by the fiends-"
        </quote></p>

    <p n="24">The dwarf hesitated. The<char> king </char> grew purple with rage. <fos type="simile">The
        courtiers smirked. <char>Trippetta</char>, pale as a corpse, advanced to the
        monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.</fos> </p>
    <p n="25">The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity. He
        seemed quite at a loss what to do or say -- how most becomingly to express his indignation.
        At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the
        contents of the brimming goblet in her face. </p>
    <p n="26">The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her
        position at the foot of the table. </p>
    <p n="27"><fos type="personification">There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling of a leaf,
        or of a feather, might have been heard.</fos> <fos type="imagery">It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and
        protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.</fos> </p>
    <p n="28"><quote> "What -- what -- what are you making that noise for?" </quote>demanded
            the<char> king </char>, turning furiously to the dwarf. </p>
    <p n="29">The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and
        looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant's face, merely ejaculated: </p>
    <p n="30">

    <p n="31"><quote> <fos type="metaphor">"The sound appeared to come from without,"</fos> </quote>observed one of the
        courtiers. <quote> "I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his
            cage-wires." </quote></p>
    <p n="32"><quote> "True," </quote>replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion;
            <quote> "but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of
            this vagabond's teeth." </quote></p>
    <p n="33">Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the<char> king </char> was too confirmed a
        joker to object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very
        repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as
        desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very
        perceptible ill effect, <char>Hop-Frog</char> entered at once, and with spirit,
        into the plans for the masquerade. </p>
    <p n="34"><quote> "I cannot tell what was the association of idea," </quote>observed he, very
        tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, <quote> "but just after your
            majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face -- just after your majesty
            had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, there
            came into my mind a capital diversion -- one of my own country frolics -- often enacted
            among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately,
            however, it requires a company of eight persons and-" </quote></p>
    <p n="35"><quote> "Here we are!" </quote>cried the<char> king </char>, laughing at
        his acute discovery of the coincidence; <quote> "eight to a fraction -- I and my seven
            ministers. Come! what is the diversion?" </quote></p>
    <p n="36"><quote> "We call it," </quote>replied the cripple, <quote> <fos type="metaphor">"the Eight Chained
            Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent sport if well enacted."</fos> </quote></p>
    <p n="37"><quote> "We will enact it," </quote>remarked the<char> king </char>,
        drawing himself up, and lowering his eyelids. </p>
    <p n="38"><quote> "The beauty of the game," </quote>continued <char>Hop-Frog</char>,
            <quote> "lies in the fright it occasions among the women." </quote></p>
    <p n="39"><quote> "Capital!" </quote>roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry. </p>
    <p n="40"><quote> "I will equip you as ourang-outangs," </quote>proceeded the dwarf; <quote>
            "leave all that to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of
            masqueraders will take you for real beasts -- and of course, they will be as much
            terrified as astonished." </quote></p>
    <p n="41"><quote> "Oh, this is exquisite!" </quote>exclaimed the<char> king </char>.
            <quote> "<char>Hop-Frog</char>! I will make a man of you."
        </quote></p>
    <p n="42">        <quote> "The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling. You
            are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers. Your majesty cannot conceive
            the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be
            real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of
            delicately and gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is inimitable!" </quote>
    </p>
    <p n="43"><quote> "It must be," </quote>said the<char> king </char>: and the council
        arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of
            <char>Hop-Frog</char>. </p>
    <p n="44">His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective
        enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely
        been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were
        sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was
        thus thought to be secured. </p>
    <p n="45">The<char> king </char> and his ministers were first encased in
        tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage
        of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once
        overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair
        of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flax. A thick
        coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long chain was
        now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the<char> king </char>, and
        tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the
        same manner. When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart
        from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural,
            <char>Hop-Frog</char> passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at
        right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who
        capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo. </p>
    <p n="46"><fos type="imagery">The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very
        lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top. At night (the
        season for which the apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a
        large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or
        elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this
        latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.</fos> </p>
    <p n="47">The arrangements of the room had been left to <char>Trippetta's</char>
        superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer
        judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the
        chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite
        impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the
        guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to
        keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional sconces were
        set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was
        placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the wall -- some fifty
        or sixty altogether. </p>
    <p n="48"><fos type="imagery">The eight ourang-outangs, taking <char>Hop-Frog's</char> advice, waited
        patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before
        making their appearance.</fos> No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed,
        or rather rolled in, all together -- for the impediments of their chains caused most of the
        party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered. </p>
    <p n="49">The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of
            the<char> king </char> with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a
        few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in
        reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women swooned with affright; and had
        not the<char> king </char> taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the
        saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general
        rush was made for the doors; but the<char> king </char> had ordered them to be
        locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had been
        deposited with him. </p>
    <p n="50">While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own
        safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd),
        the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its
        removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came
        within three feet of the floor. </p>
    <p n="51">Soon after this, the<char> king </char> and his seven friends having reeled
        about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of
        course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who
        had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold
        of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle
        diametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook
        from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen
        agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and,
        as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and
        face to face. </p>
    <p n="52">The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm;
        and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud
        shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes. </p>
    <p n="53"><quote> "Leave them to me!" </quote>now screamed <char>Hop-Frog</char>, his
        shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din. <quote> "Leave them to me. I
            fancy I know them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are."
        </quote></p>
    <p n="54">Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when,
        seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre of the
        room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the<char> king </char>s head, and
        thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of
        ourang-outangs, and still screaming: <quote> "I shall soon find out who they are!"
        </quote></p>
    <p n="55">And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter,
        the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about
        thirty feet -- dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them
        suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. <char>Hop-Frog</char>,
        clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the
        eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down
        toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were. </p>
    <p n="56">So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence,
        of about a minute's duration, ensued. It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating
        sound, as had before attracted the attention of the<char> king </char> and his
        councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of <char>Trippetta</char>.
        But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued. It
        came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at
        the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances
        of the<char> king </char> and his seven companions. </p>
    <p n="57"><quote> "Ah, ha!" </quote>said at length the infuriated jester. <quote> "Ah, ha! I
            begin to see who these people are now!" </quote>Here, pretending to scrutinize
            the<char> king </char> more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat
        which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than
        half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the
        multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render
        them the slightest assistance. </p>
    <p n="58">At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb
        higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd
        again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once
        more spoke: </p>
    <p n="59"><quote> "I now see distinctly." </quote>he said, <quote> "what manner of people these
            maskers are. They are a great<char> king </char> and his seven
            privy-councillors, -- a<char> king </char> who does not scruple to strike a
            defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I
            am simply <char>Hop-Frog</char>, the jester -- and this is my last jest."
        </quote></p>
    <p n="60">Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered,
        the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was
        complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and
        indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the
        ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light. </p>
    <p n="61">It is supposed that <char>Trippetta</char>, stationed on the roof of the
        saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they
        effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again. </p>

    <p n="1"> I CANNOT, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I first
        became acquainted with the <char>lady Ligeia</char> . Long years have since
        elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring
        these points to mind, because, in truth, the char of my beloved, her rare learning, her
        singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and <fos type="alliteration">enthralling eloquence </fos><fos type="personification">of her low
        musical language</fos>, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily
        progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. <fos type="imagery">Yet I believe that I met her first
        and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine.</fos> Of her family --I have
        surely heard her speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. <char>
            Ligeia </char>! <char> Ligeia </char>! in studies of a nature more than
        all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone
        --by <char> Ligeia </char> --that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of
        her who is no more. <fos type="irony">And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never
        known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who became the
        partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom.</fos> Was it a playful charge on the part
        of my <char> Ligeia </char>? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I
        should institute no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own --<fos type="metaphor">a
        wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion?</fos> I but indistinctly
        recall the fact itself --what wonder that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances which
        originated or attended it? And, indeed, if ever she, the wan and<fos type="personification"> the misty-winged Ashtophet
        of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell,<fos type="irony"> over marriages ill-omened,</fos> then most surely she
        presided over mine.</fos></p>
    <p n="2"> There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is the
        person of <char> Ligeia </char>. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and,
        in her latter days, even emaciated. <fos type="imagery">I would <fos type="hyperbole">in vain attempt</fos> to portray the majesty, the
        quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her
        footfall.</fos> <fos type="simile">She came and departed as a shadow.</fos> I was never made aware of her entrance into my
        closed study save by the <fos type="personification">dear music of her low sweet voice</fos>, as she placed her marble hand
        upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. <fos type="imagery"><fos type="metaphor">It was the radiance of an
        opium-dream </fos>--an airy and spirit-lifting vision <fos type="hyperbole">more wildly divine</fos> than the phantasies which
        hovered vision about the <fos type="alliteration">slumbering souls </fos>of the daughters of Delos.</fos> Yet her features were
        not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical
        labors of the heathen. <quote> "There is no exquisite beauty," says Bacon, Lord Verulam,
            speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty, without some strangeness in the
            proportion." Yet, although I saw that the features of <char> Ligeia </char>
            were not of a classic regularity --although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed
                <quote>"exquisite,"</quote> and felt that there was much of
              <fos type="personification">  <quote>"strangeness"</quote> pervading it</fos>, yet I have tried in vain to detect the
            irregularity and to trace home my own perception of <quote>"the strange."</quote> I
            examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead --it was faultless --<fos type="hyperbole">how cold indeed
            that word when applied to a majesty so divine</fos>! --<fos type="metaphor"><fos type="imagery">the skin rivalling the purest ivory,</fos></fos>
            the commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above the
            temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling
            tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet, "hyacinthine!" </quote><fos type="imagery">I
        looked at the delicate outlines of the nose --and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of
        the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection.</fos> There were the same luxurious smoothness of
        surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same<fos type="personification"> harmoniously
        curved nostrils speaking the free spirit.</fos> I regarded the<fos type="imagery"> sweet mouth.</fos> Here was indeed the
        triumph of all things heavenly --<fos type="imagery"><fos type="hyperbole">the magnificent turn of the short upper lip</fos></fos> --the soft,
        voluptuous slumber of the under --the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke --the
        teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which
        fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. I
        scrutinized the formation of the chin --and here, too, <fos type="imagery">I found the gentleness of breadth,
        the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek --<fos type="metaphor">the contour
        which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian.</fos></fos> And
        then I peered into the large eyes of <char> Ligeia </char>. </p>
    <p n="3">For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been, too,
        that in these eves of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I
        must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race. <fos type="simile">They were even fuller than
        the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad.</fos> Yet it was only at
        intervals --in moments of intense excitement --that this peculiarity became more than
        slightly noticeable in <char> Ligeia </char>. <fos type="imagery">And at such moments was her beauty
        --in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps --the beauty of beings either above or apart
        from the earth --the beauty of the fabulous Houri of the Turk.</fos><fos type="imagery"> The hue of the orbs was the
        most<fos type="alliteration"> brilliant of black,</fos> and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length</fos>. The brows,
        slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The <quote> "strangeness,"
        </quote>however, which I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation, or
        the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to the
        expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our
        ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of <char> Ligeia
        </char>! How for long hours have I pondered upon it!<fos type="hyperbole"> How have I, through the whole of a
        midsummer night, struggled to fathom it!</fos> <fos type="imagery">What was it --that something more profound than the
        well of Democritus --which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? What was it? I was
        possessed with a passion to discover.</fos> <fos type="hyperbole">Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine
        orbs!</fos> <fos type="metaphor">they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.</fos> </p>
    <p n="4">There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of
        mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact --never, I believe, noticed in the schools
        --that, in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often find
        ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember.
       <fos type="imagery"> And thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of <char> Ligeia </char>'s eyes,
        have I felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression --felt it approaching --yet
        not quite be mine --and so at length entirely depart</fos>! <fos type="metaphor">And (strange, oh strangest mystery of
        all!) I found, in the commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to theat
        expression. </fos><fos type="metaphor">I mean to say that, subsequently to the period when <char> Ligeia's
        </char> beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from
        many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt always aroused within me
        by her large and luminous orbs.</fos> Yet not the more could I define that sentiment, or analyze,
        or even steadily view it. <fos type="imagery">I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a
        rapidly-growing vine --in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of
        running water. I have felt it in the ocean; in the falling of a meteor. <fos type="personification"> I have felt it in
        the glances of unusually aged people.</fos></fos> <fos type="imagery">And there are one or two stars in heaven --(one
        especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large
        star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the feeling.</fos> <fos type="imagery"><fos type="personification">I
        have been filled with it </fos>by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently
        by passages from books.</fos> Among innumerable other instances, I well remember something in a
        volume of <char>Joseph Glanvill</char>, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness --who shall say?) never
        failed to inspire me with the sentiment; --<quote>"And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who
        knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all
        things by nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death
        utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will." </quote></p>
    <p n="5">Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace, indeed,
        some remote connection between this passage in the English moralist and a portion of the
        char of <char> Ligeia </char>. <fos type="imagery">An intensity in thought, action, or speech,
        was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which,
        during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more immediate <fos type="personification">evidence of its
        existence.</fos> </fos><fos type="metaphor">Of all the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid
            <char> Ligeia </char>, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous
        vultures of stern passion.</fos> And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by the
        miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me --by the
        almost <fos type="alliteration">magical melody, modulation,</fos> distinctness and placidity of her very low voice --and by
        the <fos type="imagery">fierce energy</fos> (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of
        the <fos type="alliteration">wild words</fos> which she habitually uttered.</p>
    <p n="6"> <fos type="imagery">I have spoken of the learning of <char> Ligeia </char>: it was
        immense --such as I have never known in woman</fos>. <fos type="imagery">In the classical tongues was she deeply
        proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of
        Europe, <fos type="hyperbole">I have never known her at fault.</fos> </fos>Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because
        simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy, have I ever found
            <char> Ligeia </char> at fault? How singularly --how thrillingly, this one
        point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my
        attention! I said her knowledge was such as I have never known in woman --but where breathes
        the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral, physical, and
        mathematical science? <fos type="imagery">I saw not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of
            <char> Ligeia </char> were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently
        aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her
        guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily
        occupied during the earlier years of our marriage.</fos> <fos type="imagery">With how vast a triumph --with how vivid
        a delight --with how much of all that is ethereal in hope --did I feel, as she bent over me
        in studies but little sought --but less known --that delicious vista by slow degrees
        expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I might at length
        pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!</fos></p>
    <p n="7"> <fos type="personification">How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years, I
        beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away! </fos><fos type="simile">Without

        which we were immersed.</fos> <fos type="simile">Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden,
        grew duller than Saturnian lead</fos>. And now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the
        pages over which I pored. <char> Ligeia </char> grew ill. <fos type="metaphor">The wild eyes blazed
        with a too --too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue
        of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with
        the tides of the gentle emotion. </fos><fos type="metaphor">I saw that she must die --and I struggled desperately in
        spirit with the grim Azrael.</fos> And the struggles of the passionate wife were, to my
        astonishment, even more energetic than my own.<fos type="metaphor"> There had been much in her stern nature to
        impress me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors; --but
        not so.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">Words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with
        which she wrestled with the Shadow. </fos><fos type="imagery">I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle.</fos> <fos type="imagery">I would
        have soothed --I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life,
        --for life --but for life --solace and reason were the uttermost folly. </fos><fos type="personification">Yet not until the
        last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the
        external placidity of her demeanor. </fos><fos type="imagery">Her voice grew more gentle --grew more low --yet I would
        not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. </fos><fos type="personification">My brain reeled as I

        mortality had never before known</fos>.</p>
    <p n="8"> That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have been easily
        aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary passion. But in
        death only, was I fully impressed with the strength of her affection. <fos type="metaphor">For long hours,
        detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than
        passionate devotion amounted to idolatry.</fos> <fos type="personification">How had I deserved to be so blessed by such
        confessions? --how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour

            <char> Ligeia's </char> more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all
        unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the principle of her longing with
        so wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away.</fos> <fos type="personification">It is this
        wild longing --it is this eager vehemence of desire for life --but for life --that I have no
        power to portray --no utterance capable of expressing.</fos> </p>
    <p n="9">At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily, to
        her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before. I
        obeyed her. --They were these:</p>
    <p n="10"><fos type="imagery"> Lo! 'tis a gala night Within the lonesome latter years! </fos><fos type="metaphor">An angel throng,
        bewinged, bedight In veils, and drowned in tears, Sit in a theatre, to see A play of hopes
        and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully The music of the spheres</fos>.</p>
    <p n="11"> <fos type="personification">Mimes, in the form of God on high, Mutter and mumble low, And hither and

    <p n="12"> <fos type="imagery">That motley drama! --oh, be sure It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom
        chased forever more, By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in

        plot.</fos></p>
    <p n="13"> <fos type="personification">But see, amid the mimic rout, A crawling shape intrude! </fos>A blood-red thing

    <p n="14"> <fos type="metaphor">Out --out are the lights --out all! And over each quivering form, The curtain, a

        Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, <quote>"Man,"</quote> And its hero the Conqueror
        Worm.</fos></p>
    <p n="15">
        <quote> "O God!" </quote>half shrieked <char> Ligeia </char>, leaping to her feet
        and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines --<fos type="imagery"><quote>"O
        God! O Divine Father! --shall these things be undeviatingly so? --shall this Conqueror be

        only through the weakness of his feeble will."</quote></fos></p>
    <p n="16"> And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall,
        and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her last sighs, there came
        mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear and distinguished,
        again, the concluding words of the passage in Glanvill --<fos type="personification"><quote>"Man doth not yield him to the
        angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will." </quote></fos></p>
    <p n="17">She died; --and I, <fos type="metaphor">crushed into the very dust with sorrow,</fos> could no longer
        endure the lonely <fos type="alliteration">desolation of my dwelling in the <fos type="personification">dim and decaying</fos>city by the Rhine.</fos> I had
        no lack of what the world calls wealth. <char> Ligeia </char> had brought me far
        more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months,
        therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey,
        which I shall not name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair
            England.<fos type="imagery"> The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost
            savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories
        connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had
        driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. </fos>Yet although the external
        abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, I gave way,
        with a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to
        a display of more than regal magnificence within. --<fos type="simile">For such follies, even in childhood, I
        had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Alas, I feel
        how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic
        draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the
        Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! </fos><fos type="symbolism">I had become a bounden slave in the trammels
        of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. </fos>But these
        absurdities must not pause to detail. <fos type="metaphor">Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed,
        whither in a moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride --as the
        successor of the unforgotten <char> Ligeia </char> --the fair-haired and blue-eyed
            <char> Lady Rowena Trevanion,</char> of Tremaine.</fos></p>
    <p n="18"> <fos type="imagery">There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that
            <fos type="metaphor">bridal chamber</fos> which is not now visibly before me. Where were
        the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted
        to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? </fos><fos type="imagery">I
        have said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber --yet I am sadly forgetful on
        topics of deep moment --and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic display,
        to take hold upon the memory.</fos> The room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was
        pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size.<fos type="personification"> Occupying the whole southern face of the
        pentagon was the sole window --an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice --a single
        pane, and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing
        through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within.</fos> Over the upper portion of this
        huge window, extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls
        of the turret. <fos type="imagery">The ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and
        elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic,
        semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting,
        depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the same metal,
        Saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out
        of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored
        fires</fos></p>
    <p n="19">. <fos type="symbolism">Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were in various
        stations about --and there was the couch, too --bridal couch --of an Indian model, and low,
        and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above.</fos> <fos type="imagery">In each of the angles of the
        chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings
        over against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of
        the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. </fos><fos type="hyperbole">The lofty walls, gigantic in height
        --even unproportionably so --were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and
        massive-looking tapestry --tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the
        floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the
        gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the
        richest cloth of gold. </fos>It was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque
        figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty
        black. But these figures partook of the true char of the arabesque only when regarded
        from a single point of view. <fos type="personification">By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very
        remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one entering the room,
        they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this
        appearance gradually departed; and step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the
        chamber, he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which
        belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk. The
        phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong
        continual current of wind behind the draperies --giving a hideous and uneasy animation to
        the whole.</fos></p>
    <p n="20"> <fos type="imagery">In halls such as these --in a <fos type="metaphor">bridal chamber</fos> such
        as this --I passed, with the <char>Lady of Tremaine</char>, the unhallowed hours
        of the first month of our marriage --passed them with but little disquietude. That my wife
        dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper --that she shunned me and loved me but little --I
        could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. </fos><fos type="hyperbole">I loathed her with
        a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity
        of regret!) to <char> Ligeia </char>, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the
        entombed.</fos> I revelled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her
        ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love.<fos type="imagery"> Now, then, did my spirit fully and
        freely burn with more than all the fires of her own.</fos> <fos type="personification">In the excitement of my opium dreams
        (for I was habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her
        name, during the silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day,
        as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my longing for
        the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned --ah, could it be
        forever? --upon the earth</fos>.</p>
    <p n="21"><fos type="imagery"> About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the <char>
            Lady Rowena</char> was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was
        slow.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of
        half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the turret,
        which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the
        phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">She became at length convalescent --finally
        well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder again threw her
        upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never
        altogether recovered.</fos> <fos type="foreshadowing">Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming char, and of
        more alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her
        physicians. With the increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken too
        sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe
        a similar increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by
        trivial causes of fear. </fos>She spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the
        sounds --of the slight sounds --and of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which
        she had formerly alluded. </p>
    <p n="22"><fos type="foreshadowing">One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this distressing
        subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She had just awakened from an
        unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague
        terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. </fos>I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon
        one of the ottomans of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of
        sounds which she then heard, but which I could not hear --of motions which she then saw, but
        which I could not perceive. <fos type="personification">The wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I
        wished to show her (what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those almost
        inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were
        but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind.</fos> <fos type="foreshadowing">But a deadly pallor,
        overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be
        fruitless.</fos> She appeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call. I remembered
        where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and
        hastened across the chamber to procure it. <fos type="imagery">But, as I stepped beneath the light of the
        censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention.</fos> <fos type="imagery">I had felt that some
        palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I saw that there lay
        upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a
        shadow --a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect --such as might be fancied for the
        shadow of a shade. </fos><fos type="hyperbole">But I was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and
        heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to <char>Rowena</char>.</fos> Having
        found the wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the
        lips of the fainting <char>lady</char>. She had now partially recovered, however,
        and took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened
        upon her person. <fos type="foreshadowing">It was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the
        carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as <char>Rowena</char> was
        in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall
        within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or
        four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid.</fos> If this I saw --not so
            <char>Rowena</char>. <fos type="imagery">She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forbore to
        speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, I considered, have been but the
        suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the
            <char>lady</char>, by the opium, and by the hour.</fos></p>
    <p n="23"> <fos type="imagery">Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent
        to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my
        wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the
        tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber
        which had received her as my bride</fos>. --<fos type="metaphor">Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like,
        before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the
        varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the
        censer overhead.</fos> <fos type="imagery">My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a former night,
        to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had seen the faint traces of the shadow.</fos>
       <fos type="personification"> It was there, however, no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to
        the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. </fos><fos type="imagery">Then rushed upon me a thousand memories of
            <char> Ligeia </char> --and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent
        violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which I had regarded her thus
        enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only
        and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the body of <char>Rowena</char>.</fos> </p>
    <p n="24">It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I had taken no
        note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me from my revery. --I
        felt that it came from the bed of ebony --the bed of death. I listened in an agony of
        superstitious terror --but there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision to
        detect any motion in the corpse --but there was not the slightest perceptible. Yet I could
        not have been deceived. I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened
        within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. <fos type="personification"> Many
        minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At
        length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable tinge of color
        had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids</fos>. <fos type="imagery">Through a
        species of unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no
        sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where
        I sat.</fos> <fos type="personification">Yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. </fos>I could no longer
        doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations --that <char>Rowena</char>
        still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was
        altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants --there were none
        within call --I had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many
        minutes --and this I could not venture to do. <fos type="metaphor">I therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to
        call back the spirit ill hovering.</fos> <fos type="simile">In a short period it was certain, however, that a relapse
        had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even
        more than that of marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly
        expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of
        the body; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately supervened. </fos><fos type="imagery">I fell back with a
        shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself
        up to passionate waking visions of <char> Ligeia </char>.</fos> </p>
    <p n="25"><fos type="personification">An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second time aware of
        some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I listened --in extremity of horror.</fos>
        The sound came again --it was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I saw --distinctly saw --a
        tremor upon the lips.<fos type="metaphor"> In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the
        pearly teeth.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto
        reigned there alone. </fos><fos type="metaphor">I felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was
        only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty
        thus once more had pointed out.</fos> <fos type="alliteration">There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the
        cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was even a slight
        pulsation at the heart. </fos>The <char>lady</char> lived; and with redoubled ardor I
        betook myself to the task of restoration. <fos type="personification">I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and
        used every exertion which experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. But in
        vain. Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the
        dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the
        livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of
        that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.</fos> </p>
    <p n="26"> And again I sunk into visions of <char> Ligeia </char> --and again,
        (what marvel that I shudder while I write,) again there reached my ears a low sob from the
        region of the ebony bed.<fos type="imagery"> But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that
        night? Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray
        dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only
        into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a
        struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I know not what of
        wild change in the personal appearance of the corpse?</fos> Let me hurry to a conclusion. </p>
    <p n="27"> <fos type="hyperbole">The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been
        dead, once again stirred --and now more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a
        dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any.</fos> <fos type="personification">I had long ceased to struggle
        or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of
        violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming.</fos>
        <fos type="imagery">The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before. The hues of life flushed
        up with unwonted energy into the countenance --the limbs relaxed --and, save that the
        eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the grave
        still imparted their charnel char to the figure, I might have dreamed that
            <char>Rowena</char> had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of Death. </fos><fos type="metaphor">But
        if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when,
        arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of
        one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into
        the middle of the apartment.</fos> </p>
    <p n="28"><fos type="personification">I trembled not --I stirred not --for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected
        with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing hurriedly through my brain,
        had paralyzed --had chilled me into stone.</fos> <fos type="alliteration">I stirred not --but gazed upon the apparition.
        There was a mad disorder in my thoughts --a tumult unappeasable.</fos> Could it, indeed, be the
        living <char>Rowena</char> who confronted me? Could it indeed be
            <char>Rowena</char> at all --the fair-haired, the blue-eyed <char>Lady
            Rowena</char> Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why should I doubt it? The bandage lay
        heavily about the mouth --but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing
            <char>Lady of Tremaine?</char><fos type="imagery">And the cheeks-there were the roses as in her
        noon of life --yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living <char>Lady of
            Tremaine.</char> And the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be
        hers? --but had she then grown taller since her ma<char>lady</char>? What
        inexpressible madness seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her feet!</fos>
        <fos type="simile">Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which
        had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber, huge
        masses of long and dishevelled hair; it was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight!</fos>
        And now slowly opened the eyes of the figure which stood before me. <quote> "Here then, at
            least," </quote>I shrieked aloud, <quote>"can I never --can I never be mistaken --these
            are the full, and the black, and the wild eyes --of my lost love --of the
                <char>lady</char> --of the <char>LADY LIGEIA</char>."</quote>

        <title>Manuscript Found in a Bottle</title>
        <author>by Edgar Allan Poe</author>
        <year>(published 1833)</year>
        
    </info>
    <p n="1">OF my country and of my family I have little to say. Ill usage and length of years
        have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the other. Hereditary wealth afforded me
        an education of no common order, and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize
        <fos type="imagery">the stores which early study very diligently garnered up.</fos> Beyond all things the works of the
        German moralists gave me great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their
        eloquent madness, but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to
        detect their falsities. I have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius --a
        deficiency of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime --and the Pyrrhonism of my
        opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed a strong relish for physical
        philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my mind with a very common error of this age --I mean the
        habit of referring occurrences, even the least susceptible of such reference, to the
        principles of that science. <fos type="personification">Upon the whole, no person could be less liable than myself to be
        led away from the severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition</fos>.<fos type="metaphor"> I have
        thought proper to premise thus much lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be
        considered rather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience of a mind
        to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity</fos>.</p>

    <p n="2">After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18-- , from the port
        of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago of the
        Sunda islands. <fos type="simile">I went as passenger --having no other inducement than a kind of nervous
        restlessness which haunted me like a fiend</fos>.</p>

    <p n="3">Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons, copper-fastened, and
        built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from the
        Lachadive islands. We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of
        opium. The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank.</p>

    <p n="4">We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood along the
        eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than
        the occasional meeting with some of the small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were
        bound. One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular, isolated cloud,
        to the N. W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as from its being the first we had
        seen since our departure from Batavia.<fos type="metaphor"> I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread
        all at once to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of
        vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach.</fos><fos type="imagery"> My notice was soon afterwards attracted by
        the duskyred appearance of the moon, and the peculiar char of the sea.</fos> The latter was
        undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I
        could distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, <fos type="simile">I found the ship in fifteen fathoms.
        The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those
        arising from heated iron.</fos> <fos type="personification">As night came on, every breath of wind died away, and a more
        entire calm it is impossible to conceive</fos>. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop without
        the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung
        without the possibility of detecting a vibration. However, as the
            <char>captain</char> said he could perceive no indication of danger, and as we
        were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go.
        No watch was set, and the <char>crew</char>, consisting principally of Malays,
        stretched themselves deliberately upon deck. <fos type="foreshadowing">I went below --not without a full presentiment
        of evil. </fos>Indeed every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I told the
            <char>captain</char> my fears --but he paid no attention to what I said, and
        left me without deigning to give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me from
        sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.<fos type="personification"> As I placed my foot upon the upper step of
        the companion-ladder, I was startled with a loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the
        rapid revolution of a mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship
        quivering to its centre. </fos><fos type="metaphor">In the next instant, a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our
        beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to
        stern.</fos></p>

    <p n="5"><fos type="metaphor">The extreme fury of the blast proved in a great measure the salvation of the ship.</fos>
        <fos type="personification">Although completely water-logged, yet, as all her masts had gone by the board, she rose,
        after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of
        the tempest, finally righted.</fos></p>

    <p n="6"><fos type="metaphor">By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. </fos>Stunned by the shock
        of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in between the stern-post and rudder.
        <fos type="imagery">With great difficulty I gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck
        with the idea of our being among breakers, so terrific beyond the wildest imagination was
        the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed</fos>. After a while,
        I heard the voice of an <char>old Swede</char>, who had shipped with us at the
        moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to him with all my strength, and presently he came
        reeling aft. We soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident. All on
        deck, with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard, and the
            <char>captain</char> and mates must have perished as they slept, for the
        cabins were deluged with water. Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the
        security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation
        of going down. <fos type="metaphor">Our cable had, of course, parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the
        hurricane, or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed.</fos> We scudded with frightful
        velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us. The frame-work of our
        stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received considerable
        injury --but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great
        shifting of our ballast. <fos type="personification">The main fury of the Simoom had already blown over, and we
        apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind --but we looked forward to its total
        cessation with dismay, well believing, that, in our shattered condition, we should
        inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue</fos>. But this very just apprehension
        seemed by no means likely to be soon verified.<fos type="personification"> For five entire days and nights --during
        which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty
        from the forecastle --the hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding
        flaws of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more
        terrific than any tempest I had before encountered.</fos> Our course for the first four days was,
        with trifling variations, S. E. and by South; and we must have run down the coast of New
        Holland. On the fifth day the cold became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a
        point more to the northward. <fos type="personification">The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a very
        few degrees above the horizon --emitting no decisive light.</fos> There were no clouds whatever
        apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury.
        About noon, as nearly as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance
        of the sun. It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow
        unaccompanied by any ray. <fos type="metaphor">Just before sinking within the turgid sea its central fires
        suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power.</fos><fos type="imagery"> It was a dim,
        silver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.</fos></p>

    <p n="7">We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day --that day to me has not arrived
        --to the Swede, never did arrive.<fos type="imagery"> Thenceforward we were enshrouded in pitchy darkness, so
        that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship.</fos> Eternal night continued
        to envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been
        accustomed in the tropics. We observed too, that, although the tempest continued to rage
        with unabated violence, there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf,
        or foam, which had hitherto attended us. All around was horror, and thick gloom, and a black
        sweltering desert of ebony.<fos type="personification"> Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of
            <char> the old Swede </char>, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder.</fos>
        We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and securing ourselves as well as
        possible to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had
        no means of calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We were,
        however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators,
        and felt extreme amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice. In the meantime
        every moment threatened to be our last --every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us.
        The swell surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried
        is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and reminded me of the
        excellent qualities of our ship --but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of
        hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could defer
        beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black
        stupendous seas became more dismally appalling. At times we gasped for breath at an
        elevation beyond the Albatross --at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into
        some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the
        Kraken.</p>

    <p n="8"><fos type="metaphor">We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream from my companion
        broke fearfully upon the night.</fos> <quote>"See! see!"</quote> --cried he, shrieking in my ears,
        -- <quote>"Almighty God! see! see!"</quote> As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen
        glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a
        fitful brilliancy upon our deck. Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze
        the current of my blood. At a terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of
        the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of nearly four thousand tons. Although
        upreared upon the summit of a wave of more than a hundred times her own altitude, her
        apparent size still exceeded that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. Her
        huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship.
        A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed off from their
        polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her
        rigging. But what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up
        under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable
        hurricane. <fos type="simile">When we first discovered her, her stupendous bows were alone to be seen, as she
        rose up, like a demon of the deep, slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her. </fos>For a
        moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her
        own sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and --came down.</p>

    <p n="9"><fos type="metaphor">At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my spirit.
        Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Our
        own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea.</fos>
       <fos type="personification"> The shock of the descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame
        which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me with irresistible
        violence upon the rigging of the stranger.</fos></p>

    <p n="10">As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about, and to the confusion ensuing I
        attributed my escape from the notice of the <char>crew</char>. With little
        difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was partially open, and
        soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. <fos type="metaphor">A
        nameless and indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had
        taken hold of my mind, was perhaps the principle of my concealment.</fos> I was unwilling to trust
        myself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I had taken, so many
        points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I therefore thought proper to contrive a
        hiding-place in the hold. This I did by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards in
        such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the
        ship.</p>

    <p n="11">I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use
        of it. A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait. I could not
        see his face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance. There was about it
        an evidence of great age and infirmity. <fos type="personification">His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his
        entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a low broken tone, some
        words of a language which I could not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of
        singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation.</fos> <fos type="metaphor">His manner was a wild
        mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of a god. </fos>He at
        length went on deck, and I saw him no more.</p>

    

    <p n="12"><fos type="metaphor">A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul -- a sensation
        which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of by-gone time are inadequate, and
        for which I fear futurity itself will offer me no key</fos>. To a mind constituted like my own the
        latter consideration is an evil. <fos type="hyperbole">I shall never, -- I know that I shall never -- be satisfied
        with regard to the nature of my conceptions.</fos> Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions
        are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel. A new sense, a new
        entity is added to my soul.</p>

    <p n="13"><fos type="metaphor">It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the rays of my
        destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus.</fos> Incomprehensible men! Wrapped up in meditations
        of a kind which I cannot divine, they pass me by unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my
        part, for the people will not see. It was but just now that <fos type="imagery">I passed directly before the
        eyes of the mate, -- it was no long while ago that I ventured into the <char>captain's
        </char>own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which I write, and have
        written.</fos> I shall from time to time continue this journal. It is true that I may not find an
        opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will not fail to make the endeavor. At
        the last moment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.</p>

    <p n="14"><fos type="metaphor">An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation. </fos><fos type="personification">Are such things
        the operations of ungoverned Chance?</fos> I had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down,
        without attracting any notice, among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails in the bottom of
        the yawl. While musing upon the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a
        tar-brush the edges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel. <fos type="symbolism">The
        studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread
        out into the word DISCOVERY.</fos></p>

    <p n="15">I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel. Although well
        armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war. Her rigging, build, and general equipment, all
        negative a supposition of this kind. What she is not I can easily perceive, what she is I
        fear it is impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model
        and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvass, her severely
        simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of
        familiar things, and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection,
        an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.</p>

    <p n="16">I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. <fos type="personification">She is built of a material to which I
        am a stranger.</fos> There is a peculiar char about the wood which strikes me as rendering it
        unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied. I mean its extreme porousness,
        considered independently of the wormeaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in
        these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age. It will appear perhaps an
        observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood has every charistic of Spanish oak, if
        Spanish oak were distended or swelled by any unnatural means.</p>

    <p n="17">In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weather-beaten Dutch
        navigator comes full upon my recollection.<quote> "It is as sure,"</quote> he was wont to
        say, when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, <quote>"as sure as there is a sea where
            the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the
        seaman."</quote></p>

    <p n="18">About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the
            <char>crew</char>. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood
        in the very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence.<fos type="metaphor"> Like the one I had
        at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age.</fos> <fos type="personification">Their
        knees trembled with infirmity, their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude, their
        shrivelled skins rattled in the wind, their voices were low, tremulous, and broken, their
        eyes glistened with the rheum of years, and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the
        tempest. </fos>Around them on every part of the deck lay scattered mathematical instruments of the
        most quaint and obsolete construction.</p>

    <p n="19">I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail. From that period the ship,
        being thrown dead off the wind, has held her terrific course due south, with every rag of
        canvass packed upon her from her trucks to her lower-studding-sail booms, and rolling every
        moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter
        into the mind of man to imagine. I have just left the deck, where I find it impossible to
        maintain a footing, although the <char>crew</char> seem to experience little
        inconvenience. It appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not buried
        up at once and forever. <fos type="metaphor">We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of
        Eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss.</fos> <fos type="personification">From billows a thousand times more
        stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away with the facility of the arrowy
        sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep, but
        like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy.</fos> I am led to attribute these
        frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effect. I must suppose
        the ship to be within the influence of some strong current, or impetuous
        under-tow.</p>

    <p n="20">I have seen the <char>captain</char> face to face, and in his own cabin --
        but, as I expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance there is, to a
        casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man --still a feeling of
        irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which I regarded
        him. In stature he is nearly my own height, that is, about five feet eight inches. He is of
        a well-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably otherwise. But it is
        the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the face, it is the intense, the
        wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age so utter, so extreme, which excites within my
        spirit a sense --a sentiment ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to
        bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years. <fos type="metaphor">His gray hairs are records of the past, and his
        grayer eyes are sybils of the future.</fos> The cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange,
        iron-clasped folios, and mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten
        charts. His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored with a fiery unquiet eye over a
        paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore the signature of a
        monarch. He muttered to himself, as did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low
        peevish syllables of a foreign tongue, and although the speaker was close at my elbow, yet
        his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.</p>

    <p n="21"><fos type="metaphor">The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. </fos><fos type="simile">The
            <char>crew</char> glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries, their
        eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning, and when their figures fall athwart my path in the
        wild glare of the battle-latterns, I feel as I have never felt before, although I have been
        all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at
        Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin.</fos></p>

    <p n="22">When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions. If I trembled at the
        blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and
        ocean, to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective!
       <fos type="metaphor"> All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of
        foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at
        intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like
        the walls of the universe.</fos></p>

    <p n="23"><fos type="simile">As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation can properly
        be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the
        southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract.</fos></p>

    <p n="24">To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly impossible --yet a
        curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions predominates even over my
        despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death. <fos type="metaphor">It is evident that we
        are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge --some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose
        attainment is destruction. </fos>Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself --it
        must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its
        favor.</p>

    <p n="25"><fos type="imagery">The <char>crew</char> pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step, but
        there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the
        apathy of despair.</fos></p>

    <p n="26"><fos type="personification">In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and as we carry a crowd of canvass,
        the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea --Oh, horror upon horror!</fos> <fos type="imagery">the ice opens
        suddenly to the right, and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric
        circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls
        is lost in the darkness and the distance.</fos> But little time will be left me to ponder upon my
        destiny --the circles rapidly grow small --we are plunging madly within the grasp of the
        whirlpool --and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and shrieking of ocean and of tempest, the
        ship is quivering, oh God! and --going down.</p>

        <title>Mesmeric Revelation</title>
        <author>by Edgar Allan Poe</author>
        <year>(published 1849)</year>
         
    </info>
    <p n="1"> <fos type="metaphor">WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism, its startling
        facts are now almost universally admitted. Of these latter, those who doubt, are your mere
        doubters by profession -- an unprofitable and disreputable tribe.</fos> There can be no more
        absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove, at the present day, that man, by mere
        exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an abnormal condition, of
        which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death, or at least resemble them more
        nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,
        while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly, the
        external organs of sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through
        channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover,
        his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies with
        the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally, that his susceptibility to the
        impression increases with its frequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar
        phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced. </p>
    <p n="2">I say that these -- which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features --
        it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict upon my readers so needless a
        demonstration; to-day. My purpose at present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled,
        even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very remarkable
        substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and myself. </p>
    <p n="3">I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question, (Mr.
        Vankirk,) and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had
        supervened. For many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more
        distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of
        Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside. </p>
    <p n="4"><fos type="imagery">The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart, and
        breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma.</fos> In spasms such
        as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres,
        but to-night this had been attempted in vain.</p>
    <p n="5"> As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although
        evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease. </p>
    <p n="6"><quote> "I sent for you to-night," he said, " </quote>not so much to administer
        to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which, of
        late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. <fos type="personification">I need not tell you how sceptical I have
        hitherto been on the topic of the soul's immortality. </fos>I cannot deny that there has always
        existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of its
        own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction. With it my reason
        had nothing to do. All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more
        sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own works as
        well as in those of his European and American echoes. The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson,
        for example, was placed in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found
        it logical, but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial
        arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it seemed evident to me
        that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly
        forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in
        perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he will
        never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the
        moralists of England, of France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but
        take no hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will always
        in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will may assent -- the soul --
        the intellect, never. </p>
    <p n="7">"I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed. But
        latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling, until it has come so nearly to
        resemble the acquiescence of reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the
        two. I am enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence. I cannot
        better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to
        perceive a train of ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in
        full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through its effect,
        into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning and its conclusion -- the cause and
        its effect -- are present together. In my natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect
        only, and perhaps only partially, remains. </p>
    <p n="8">
        <quote><fos type="metaphor"> "These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a
            series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized.</fos> <fos type="personification">You have often
            observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker -- the extensive
            knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and
            from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism."</fos>

    <p n="9"> I consented of course to make this experiment. A few passes threw Mr. Vankirk
        into the mesmeric sleep. <fos type="imagery">His breathing became immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer
        no physical uneasiness.</fos> The following conversation then ensued: --  V. in
        the dialogue representing the patient, and  P. myself. </p>

            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort
                than I feel able to make. You do not question me properly.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  What then shall I ask ? </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  You must begin at the beginning.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  The beginning ! but where is the beginning ?</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  You know that the beginning is GOD. [This was said
                in a low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound
                veneration.]</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  What then is God ?</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  [Hesitating for many minutes.] I cannot tell. </char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  Is not God spirit ? </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  While I was awake I knew what you meant by <quote>
                    "spirit," </quote> but now it seems only a word -- such for instance as truth,
                beauty -- a quality, I mean.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  Is not God immaterial ?</char>
            <char speaker="V">
                 V.  There is no immateriality -- it is a mere word. That which
                is not matter, is not at all -- unless qualities are things.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  Is God, then, material ? </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  No. [This reply startled me very much.]</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  What then is he ? </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  [After a long pause, and mutteringly.] I see -- but
                it is a thing difficult to tell. [Another long pause.] He is not spirit, for he
                exists. Nor is he matter, as you understand it. But there are gradations of matter
                of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the
                grosser. <fos type="personification">The atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while the
                electric principle permeates the atmosphere.</fos> These gradations of matter increase in
                rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a matter unparticled -- without particles --
                indivisible -- one and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified. The
                ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only permeates all things but impels all things
                -- and thus is all things within itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to
                embody in the word <quote> "thought," </quote> is this matter in motion.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  The metaphysicians maintain that all action is
                reducible to motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the
                former.</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is
                the action of mind -- not of thinking. <fos type="metaphor">The unparticled matter, or God, in
                quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind.</fos> And the power
                of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is, in the unparticled
                matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence; how I know not, and now clearly
                see that I shall never know. But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or
                quality, existing within itself, is thinking. </char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  Can you give me no more precise idea of what you
                term the unparticled matter ?</char>
            <char speaker="V">
                 V.  The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses in
                gradation. <fos type="imagery">We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of water, the
                atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous ether. </fos>Now we call all
                these things matter, and embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite
                of this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we
                attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach
                the latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or
                with nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its
                atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom,
                as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight.
                Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to
                regard the ether as an entity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we
                might term it spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether -- conceive a
                matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal,
                and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass -- an
                unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms
                themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity.
                There will be a point -- there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms
                are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely
                coalesce. But the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the
                nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear,
                however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it is impossible to
                conceive spirit, since it is impossible to imagine what is not. When we flatter
                ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely deceived our
                understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of
                absolute coalescence; -- and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the
                heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space -- a resistance now ascertained,
                it is true, to exist in some degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to
                have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton. We know that the
                resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their density. <fos type="metaphor">Absolute
                coalescence is absolute density.</fos> Where there are no interspaces, there can be no
                yielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to
                the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  Your objection is answered with an ease which is
                nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerability. -- <fos type="imagery">As regards the progress of
                the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the
                ether through it. </fos>There is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which
                reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage
                through an ether: for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to
                all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those
                astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible
                to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand, about
                that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous
                passage through the orb. In the one case, the retarding force is momentary and
                complete within itself -- in the other it is endlessly accumulative.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  But in all this -- in this identification of mere
                matter with God -- is there nothing of irreverence? [I was forced to repeat this
                question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning.]</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  Can you say why matter should be less reverenced
                than mind? But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the
                very <quote> "mind" or "spirit" of the schools, so far as regards its high
                    capacities, and is, moreover, the "matter" </quote> of these schools at the same
                time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of
                matter.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is
                thought?</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  In general, this motion is the universal thought of

            <char speaker="P"> P.  You say, <quote> "in general." </quote></char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  Yes. The universal mind is God. For new

            <char speaker="V">
                 V.  Yes -- to avoid confusion. When I say <quote> "mind," I mean
                    the unparticled or ultimate matter; by "matter" </quote> I intend all
                else.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  You were saying that <quote> "for new individualities matter
                    is necessary." </quote></char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely
                God. To create individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions
                of the divine mind. Thus man is individualized.<fos type="metaphor"> Divested of corporate investiture,
                he were God.</fos> Now, the particular motion of the incarnated portions of the
                unparticled matter is the thought of man ; as the motion of the whole is that of
                God.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  You say that divested of the body man will be God? </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  [After much hesitation.] I could not have said
                this; it is an absurdity.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  [Referring to my notes.] You did say that <quote> "divested
                    of corporate investiture man were God." </quote>
            </char>
            <char speaker="V">
                 V.  And this is true. Man thus divested would be God -- would be
                unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested -- at least never will be --
                else we must imagine an action of God returning upon itself -- a purposeless and
                futile action. Man is a creature. Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of
                thought to be irrevocable. </char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the
                body?</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  I say that he will never be bodiless.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  Explain. </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  There are two bodies -- the rudimental and the
                complete ; corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly. What
                we call <quote> "death," </quote> is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present
                incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected,
                ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant. </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  We, certainly -- but not the worm. The matter of
                which our rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that body;
                or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is
                formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which the ultimate is composed. The
                ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell
                which falls, in decaying, from the inner form; not that inner form itself; but this
                inner form, as well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired
                the ultimate life.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  You have often said that the mesmeric state very
                nearly resembles death. How is this?</char>
            <char speaker="V">
                 V.  When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles
                the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in
                abeyance, and I perceive external things directly, without organs, through a medium
                which I shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  Unorganized? </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V. <fos type="metaphor"> Yes; organs are contrivances by which the
                individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of
                matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms</fos>. The organs of man are adapted
                to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being
                unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one -- the nature of
                the volition of God -- that is to say, the motion of the unparticled matter. You
                will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain.
                This it is not; but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension
                of what it is.<fos type="imagery"> A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.</fos> The
                vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar
                ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain,
                also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it. The motion of this
                latter is thought, of which perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by
                which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this
                external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its
                organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole
                body, (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no
                other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the
                luminiferous; and to this ether -- in unison with it -- the whole body vibrates,
                setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence of
                idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited
                perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs are the cages
                necessary to confine them until fledged.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  You speak of rudimental <quote> "beings." </quote>
                Are there other rudimental thinking beings than man?</char>
            <char speaker="V">
                 V.  The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebul ,
                planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebul , suns, nor planets, is for
                the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an
                infinity of rudimental beings. But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the
                ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is
                tenanted by a distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all,
                the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. <fos type="personification">At death, or metamorphosis,
                these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life -- immortality -- and cognizant of all
                secrets but the one, act all things and pass everywhere by mere volition: --
                indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the
                accommodation of which we blindly deem space created -- but that SPACE itself --
                that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows
                -- blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels.</fos></char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  You say that <quote> "but for the necessity of the
                    rudimental life" </quote> there would have been no stars. But why this
                necessity? </char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  <fos type="personification">In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic
                matter generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law --
                the Divine Volition.</fos> With the view of producing impediment, the organic life and
                matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,) were contrived.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  But again -- why need this impediment have been
                produced?</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  The result of law inviolate is perfection -- right
                -- negative happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive
                pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and substantiality
                of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a
                certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in the inorganic life is impossible,
                is possible in the organic.</char>
            <char speaker="P">
                 P.  But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?</char>
            <char speaker="V"> V.  All things are either good or bad by comparison. A
                sufficient analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of
                pain. Positive pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one point we must have
                suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed.
                But it has been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be thus the necessity
                for the organic. The pain of the primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the
                bliss of the ultimate life in Heaven.</char>
            <char speaker="P"> P.  Still, there is one of your expressions which I
                find it impossible to comprehend -- <quote> "the truly substantive vastness of
                    infinity." </quote>
            </char>
            <char speaker="V">
                 V.  This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic
                conception of the term <quote> "substance" itself. We must not regard it as a
                    quality, but as a sentiment: -- it is the perception, in thinking beings, of the
                    adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many things on the Earth,
                    which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus -- many things visible and
                    tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at
                    all. But to the inorganic beings -- to the angels -- the whole of the
                    unparticled matter is substance; that is to say, the whole of what we term
                    "space" </quote> is to them the truest substantiality; -- the stars, meantime,
                through what we consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in
                proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality,
                eludes the organic.</char>

        <p n="1"><quote>"CON tal que las costumbres de un autor,"</quote> says Don Thomas de las
            Torres, in the preface to his <quote>"Amatory Poems"</quote>
            <quote>"sean puras y castas, importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus
                obras"</quote> -- meaning, in plain English, that, provided the morals of an author are
            pure personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We presume that Don
            Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion. It would be a clever thing, too, in the way of
            poetical justice, to keep him there until his <quote>"Amatory Poems"</quote> get out of
            print, or are laid definitely upon the shelf through lack of readers. Every fiction should
            have a moral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every
            fiction has. Philip Melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon the
            <quote>"Batrachomyomachia," </quote>and proved that the poet's object was to excite a
            distaste for sedition. Pierre la Seine, going a step farther, shows that the intention was
            to recommend to young men temperance in eating and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has
            satisfied himself that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin; by Antinous, Martin
            Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more
            modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in "The
            Antediluvians," a parable in Powhatan," new views in "Cock Robin," and transcendentalism in
            "Hop O' My Thumb." <fos type="metaphor">In short, it has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a
                very profound design.</fos> Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. A novelist, for
            example, need have no care of his moral. It is there -- that is to say, it is somewhere --
            and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves. When the proper time arrives, all
            that the gentleman intended, and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in
            the <quote>"Dial,</quote>" or the <quote>"Down-Easter,"</quote> together with all that he
            ought to have intended, and the rest that he clearly meant to intend: -- so that it will all
            come very straight in the end.</p>
        <p n="2">There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by certain
            ignoramuses -- that I have never written a moral tale, or, in more precise words, a tale
            with a moral. They are not the critics predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:
            -- that is the secret. By and by the <quote> "North American Quarterly Humdrum" </quote>
            will make them ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of staying execution --
            by way of mitigating the accusations against me -- I offer the sad history appended, -- a
            history about whose obvious moral there can be no question whatever, since he who runs may
            read it in the large capitals which form the title of the tale. I should have credit for
            this arrangement -- a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others, who reserve the
            impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at the fag end of
            their fables.</p>
        <p n="3">Defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and De mortuis nil
            nisi bonum is an excellent injunction -- even if the dead in question be nothing but dead
            small beer. It is not my design, therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend,
            <char>Toby Dammit</char>.<fos type="metaphor"> He was a sad dog, it is true, and a dog's death it
                was that he died; but he himself was not to blame for his vices.</fos> They grew out of a personal
            defect in his mother. She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant -- for
            duties to her well -- regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like tough steaks,
            or the modern Greek olive trees, are invariably the better for beating -- but, poor woman!
            she had the misfortune to be left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be
            left unflogged.<fos type="personification"> The world revolves from right to left.</fos> It will not do to whip a baby from
            left to right. If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil propensity out, it
            follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks its quota of wickedness in. I was often
            present at Toby's chastisements, and, even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive
            that he was getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw, through the tears in my eyes,
            that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he had been cuffed until he
            grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for a little African, and no
            effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could stand
            it no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made prophecy
            of his ruin.</p>
        <p n="4">The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five months of age he used to
            get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. At six months, I caught him gnawing
            a pack of cards. At seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the
            female babies. At eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the
            Temperance pledge.<fos type="metaphor"> Thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until, at the
                close of the first year, he not only insisted upon<fos type="imagery"> wearing moustaches</fos>, but had contracted a
                propensity for cursing and swearing, and for backing his assertions by bets.</fos></p>
        <p n="5"><fos type="personification">Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which I had predicted to
            <char>Toby Dammit</char> overtook him at last.</fos> <fos type="simile">The fashion had <quote>"grown
                with his growth and strengthened with his strength,"</quote> so that, when he came to be
                a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition to
                gamble. Not that he actually laid wagers -- no.</fos> I will do my friend the justice to say that
            he would as soon have laid eggs. With him the thing was a mere formula -- nothing more. His
            expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were simple if not
            altogether innocent expletives -- imaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence.
            When he said <quote>"I'll bet you so and so,"</quote> nobody ever thought of taking him up;
            but still I could not help thinking it my duty to put him down. The habit was an immoral
            one, and so I told him. It was a vulgar one- this I begged him to believe. It was
            discountenanced by society -- here I said nothing but the truth. It was forbidden by act of
            Congress -- here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie. I remonstrated -- but
            to no purpose. I demonstrated -- in vain. I entreated -- he smiled. I implored -- he
            laughed. I preached- he sneered. I threatened -- he swore. I kicked him -- he called for the
            police. I pulled his nose -- he blew it, and offered to bet the <char>Devil</char>
            his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again.</p>
        <p n="6">Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of <char>Dammit's mother</char>
            had entailed upon her son. He was detestably poor, and this was the reason, no doubt, that
            his expletive expressions about betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. I will not be bound
            to say that I ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as <quote>"I'll bet you a
                dollar."</quote> It was usually <quote>"I'll bet you what you please,"</quote> or
            <quote>"I'll bet you what you dare,"</quote> or <quote>"I'll bet you a trifle,"</quote>
            or else, more significantly still, <quote>"I'll bet the <char>Devil</char> my
                head."</quote></p>
        <p n="7">This latter form seemed to please him best; -- perhaps because it involved the least
            risk; for <char>Dammit</char> had become excessively parsimonious. Had any one taken him up, his head was
            small, and thus his loss would have been small too. But these are my own reflections and I
            am by no means sure that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the phrase in
            question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his
            brains like bank-notes: -- but this was a point which my friend's perversity of disposition
            would not permit him to comprehend. In the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and
            gave himself up to <quote><fos type="hyperbole">"I'll bet the <char>Devil</char> my head,"</fos></quote> with
            a pertinacity and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. I
            am always displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a man to
            think, and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something in the air with which Mr.
            <char>Dammit</char> was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression -- something in his manner of
            enunciation -- which at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy -- something
            which, for want of a more definite term at present, I must be permitted to call queer; but
            which<char> Mr. Coleridge</char> would have called mystical, <char>Mr. Kant</char> pantheistical,<char> Mr. Carlyle</char>
            twistical, and<char> Mr. Emerson</char> hyperquizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. <fos type="personification"><char>Mr. Dammits</char>
                soul was in a perilous state.</fos> I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. I
            vowed to serve him as St. Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the toad,
            -- that is to say, <quote>"awaken him to a sense of his situation."</quote> I addressed
            myself to the task forthwith. Once more I betook myself to remonstrance. Again I collected
            my energies for a final attempt at expostulation.</p>
        <p n="8">When I had made an end of my lecture, <char>Mr. Dammit</char> indulged himself in some very
            equivocal behavior. For some moments he remained silent, merely looking me inquisitively in
            the face. But presently he threw his head to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great
            extent. Then he spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. Then he
            winked with the right eye. Then he repeated the operation with the left. Then he shut them
            both up very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I became seriously alarmed
            for the consequences. Then, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an
            indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he
            condescended to reply.</p>
        <p n="9">I can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. He would be obliged to me if I
            would hold my tongue. He wished none of my advice. He despised all my insinuations. He was
            old enough to take care of himself. Did I still think him baby <char>Dammit</char>? Did I mean to say any
            thing against his char? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool? Was my maternal
            parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? He would put this
            latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself to abide by my
            reply. Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion,
            he said, betrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the <char>Devil</char> his
            head that she did not.</p>
        <p n="10"><char>Mr. Dammit</char> did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon his heel, he left my presence
            with undignified precipitation. It was well for him that he did so.<fos type="metaphor"> My feelings had been
                wounded.</fos> Even my anger had been aroused. For once I would have taken him up upon his
            insulting wager. I would have won for the Arch-Enemy <char>Mr. Dammit's</char> little head -- for the
            fact is, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home.</p>
        <p n="11">But Khoda shefa midehed -- Heaven gives relief -- as the Mussulmans say when you
            tread upon their toes. It was in pursuance of my duty that I had been insulted, and I bore
            the insult like a man. It now seemed to me, however, that I had done all that could be
            required of me, in the case of this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him no
            longer with my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. But although I
            forebore to intrude with my advice, I could not bring myself to give up his society
            altogether.<fos type="simile"> I even went so far as to humor some of his less reprehensible propensities; and
                there were times when I found myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with
                tears in my eyes: -- so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk</fos>.</p> 
        <p n="12">One fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us in
            the direction of a river. There was a bridge, and we resolved to cross it. It was roofed
            over, by way of protection from the weather, and the archway, having but few windows, was
            thus very uncomfortably dark. As we entered the passage, the contrast between the external
            glare and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. Not so upon those of the
            unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the <char>Devil</char> his head that I was
            hipped. He seemed to be in an unusual good humor. He was excessively lively -- so much so
            that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion. It is not impossible that he was
            affected with the transcendentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of
            this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my
            friends of the <quote> "Dial" </quote> present. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of
            a certain species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend, and
            caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and
            skipping about under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting out, and now
            lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the
            world all the time. I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. At
            length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the
            footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height. Through this I made my
            way quietly, pushing it around as usual. But this turn would not serve the turn of Mr.
            Dammit. He insisted upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in
            the air. Now this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do. The best
            pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend Mr. Carlyle, and as I knew he could not
            do it, I would not believe that it could be done by <char>Toby Dammit</char>. I
            therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a braggadocio, and could not do what he
            said. For this I had reason to be sorry afterward; -- for he straightway offered to bet the
            <char>Devil</char> his head that he could.</p>
        <p n="13">I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some remonstrance
            against his impiety, when I heard, close at my elbow, a slight cough, which sounded very
            much like the ejaculation <quote> "ahem!" </quote> I started, and looked about me in
            surprise. My glance at length fell into a nook of the frame -- work of the bridge, and upon
            the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing could be more
            reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black, but his
            shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white cravat, while
            his hair was parted in front like a girl's. His hands were clasped pensively together over
            his stomach, and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head.</p>
        <p n="14">Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his
            small-clothes; and this was a thing which I thought very odd. Before I had time to make any
            remark, however, upon so singular a circumstance, he interrupted me with a second
            "ahem!"</p>
        <p n="15">To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply. The fact is, remarks of
            this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. I have known a Quarterly Review non-plussed by
            the word <quote> "Fudge!" </quote> I am not ashamed to say, therefore, that I turned to Mr.
            Dammit for assistance.</p>
        <p n="16"><quote>"Dammit,"</quote> said I,<quote> "what are you about? don't you hear? -- the
            gentleman says 'ahem!'" </quote>I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed
            him; for, to say the truth, I felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is particularly
            puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is pretty sure to look like a
            fool.</p>
        <p n="17"><quote>"<char>Dammit</char>,"</quote> observed I -- although this sounded very much like an oath,
            than which nothing was further from my thoughts -- "<char>Dammit</char>," I suggested -- "the gentleman
            says 'ahem!'"</p>
        <p n ="18">I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; I did not think it
            profound myself; but I have noticed that the effect of our speeches is not always
            proportionate with their importance in our own eyes; and if I had shot <char>Mr. D.</char> through and
            through with a Paixhan bomb, or knocked him in the head with the "Poets and Poetry of
            America," he could hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those
            simple words: "<char>Dammit</char>, what are you about?- don't you hear? -- the gentleman says
            'ahem!'"</p>
        <p n="19"><fos type="metaphor">"You don't say so?" gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a pirate runs
            up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war.</fos> "Are you quite sure he said that?
            Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may as well put a bold face upon the matter.
            Here goes, then -- ahem!"</p>
        <p n="20">At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased --<fos type="personification"> God only knows why.</fos> He left his
            station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a gracious air, took Dammit by the
            hand and shook it cordially, looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of
            the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to
            imagine.</p>
        <p n="21">"I am quite sure you will win it, <char>Dammit</char>," said he, with the frankest of all smiles,
            "but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of mere form."</p>
        <p n="22">"Ahem!" replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a
            pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable alteration in his
            countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down the corners of his mouth -- "ahem!"
            And "ahem!" said he again, after a pause; and not another word more than "ahem!" did I ever
            know him to say after that. "Aha!" thought I, without expressing myself aloud -- "this is
            quite a remarkable silence on the part of <char>Toby Dammit</char>, and is no
            doubt a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme induces another.
            I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so
            fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture? At all events, he is cured of the
            transcendentals."</p>
        <p n="23"><fos type="simile">"Ahem!" here replied Toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and looking
            like a very old sheep in a revery</fos>.</p>
        <p n="24">The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade of the
            bridge -- a few paces back from the turnstile. "My good fellow," said he, "I make it a point
            of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait here, till I take my place by the stile, so
            that I may see whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don't omit any
            flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you know. I will say 'one, two, three, and
            away.' Mind you, start at the word 'away'" Here he took his position by the stile, paused a
            moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up and, I thought, smiled very slightly,
            then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look at <char> Dammit </char>, and finally gave
            the word as agreed upon-</p>
        <p n="25">One -- two -- three -- and -- away!</p>
        <p n="26">But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, occupied only an instant. In
            less than five seconds from his starting, my poor <char>Toby </char>had taken the
            leap. <fos type="imagery">I saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge, cutting the
                most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.</fos> I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging
            it to admiration just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an unusually
            singular thing that he did not continue to go over. But the whole leap was the affair of a
            moment, and, before I had a chance to make any profound reflections, down came<char> Mr. Dammit</char> on
            the flat of his back, on the same side of the stile from which he had started. At the same
            instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt
            up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over
            the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had no leisure to think, for <char> Dammit </char>
            lay particularly still, and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood
            in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be
            termed a serious injury. The truth is, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close
            search I could not find anywhere; so I determined to take him home and send for the
            homoeopathists. <fos type="personification">In the meantime a thought struck me, and I threw open an adjacent window of
                the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once.</fos> About five feet just above the top
            of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there
            extended a flat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series
            that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the edge of this brace
            it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in
            contact.</p>
        <p n="27">He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopathists did not give him little
            enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated to take.<fos type="metaphor"> So in the end he grew
                worse, and at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers.</fos> I bedewed his grave with my
            tears, worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his
            funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. The scoundrels refused to
            pay it, so I had<char> Mr. Dammit</char> dug up at once, and sold him for dog's meat.</p>

        <p n="1">"Listen to me," said <char>the Demon</char>, as he placed his hand upon my head. "There is a spot
            upon this accursed earth which thou hast never yet beheld <fos type="simile">And if by any chance thou hast
                beheld it, it must have been in one of those vigorous dreams which come like the Simoon upon
                the brain of the sleeper who hath lain down to sleep among the forbidden sunbeams --among
                the sunbeams, I say, which slide from off the solemn columns of the melancholy temples in
                the wilderness</fos>. The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of
            the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.</p>
        
        <p n="2">"The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue --and they flow not onwards to
            the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous
            and convulsive motion. For many miles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale
            desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch
            towards the heaven their long ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting heads. And
            there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of
            subterrene water. And they sigh one unto the other.</p>
        
        <p n="3"><fos type="metaphor">"But there is a boundary to their realm --the boundary of the dark, horrible, lofty
            forest</fos>. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually.
            But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally
            hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits, one by
            one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in
            perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the grey clouds rush
            westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But
            there is no wind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there is
            neither quiet nor silence.</p>
        
        <p n="4">"It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having fallen, it
            was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies, and the rain fell upon my head
            --and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.</p>
        
        <p n="5">"And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was crimson in
            color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge grey rock which stood by the shore of the river, and
            was litten by the light of the moon. And the rock was grey, and ghastly, and tall, --and the
            rock was grey. Upon its front were chars engraven in the stone; and I walked through
            the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might read the
            chars upon the stone. But I could not decypher the chars. And I was going back
            into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon
            the rock, and upon the chars --and the chars were DESOLATION.</p>
        
        <p n="6">"And I looked upwards, and there stood a <char>man </char>upon the summit of the rock, and I hid
            myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the actions of the man. And the <char>man </char>was
            tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of
            old Rome. <fos type="metaphor">And the outlines of his figure were indistinct --but his features were the
                features of a Deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon, and of
                the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face.</fos> And his brow was lofty with thought,
            and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of
            sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude. And the moon
            shone upon his face, and upon the features of his face, and oh! they were more beautiful
            than the airy dreams which hovered about the souls of the daughters of Delos!</p>
        
        <p n="7">"And the <char>man </char>sat down upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and looked
            out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall
            primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay
            close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the <char>man
            </char>        trembled in the solitude --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.</p>
        
        <p n="8">"And the <char>man </char>turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the dreary
            river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the
            water-lilies. And the <char>man </char>listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and of the murmur that
            came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the
            man. And the <char>man </char>trembled in the solitude --but the night waned and he sat upon the
            rock.</p>
        
        <p n="9">"Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among the
            wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the
            recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto
            the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay close
            within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the <char>man </char>trembled in the solitude
            --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.</p>
        
        <p n="10">"Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful tempest
            gathered in the heaven where before there had been no wind. And the heaven became livid with
            the violence of the tempest --and the rain beat upon the head of the <char>man </char>--and the floods of
            the river came down --and the river was tormented into foam --and the water-lilies shrieked
            within their beds --and the forest crumbled before the wind --and the thunder rolled, --and
            the lightning fell --and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close within my covert
            and observed the actions of the man. And the <char>man </char>trembled in the solitude -- but the night
            waned and he sat upon the rock.</p>
        
        <p n="11">"Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and the lilies,
            and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the
            water-lilies. And they became accursed and were still. And the moon ceased to totter in its
            pathway up the heaven --and the thunder died away --and the lightning did not flash --and
            the clouds hung motionless --and the waters sunk to their level and remained --and the trees
            ceased to rock --and the water-lilies sighed no more --and the murmur was heard no longer
            from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I
            looked upon the chars of the rock, and they were changed --and the chars were

            upon the rock were SILENCE. And the <char>man </char>shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled afar

        <title>Some Words With a Mummy</title>
        <author>by Edgar Allan Poe</author>
        <year>(published 1850)</year>
        
    </info>
    <p n="1">THE symposium of the preceding evening had been a little too much for my nerves. I
        had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy. Instead of going out therefore to spend
        the evening as I had proposed, it occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just
        eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.</p>

    <p n="2">A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than a pound at
        once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there can be no material objection
        to two. And really between two and three, there is merely a single unit of difference. I
        ventured, perhaps, upon four. My wife will have it five; -- but, clearly, she has confounded
        two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to admit; but,
        concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout, without which, in the way of
        condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.</p>

    <p n="3"><fos type="metaphor">Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the serene hope of
        enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon the pillow, and, through the aid
        of a capital conscience, fell into a profound slumber forthwith.</fos></p>

    <p n="4"><fos type="personification">But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? </fos>I could not have completed my third
        snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell, and then an impatient
        thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while I was
        still rubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor
        <char>Ponnonner</char>. It ran thus:</p>

    <p n="5">
        <note>Come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive this. Come and
            help us to rejoice. At last, by long persevering diplomacy, I have gained the assent of
            the Directors of the City Museum, to my examination of the <char> Mummy</char> -- you know the one I
            mean. I have permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. A few friends only
            will be present -- you, of course. The <char> Mummy</char> is now at my house, and we shall begin to
            unroll it at eleven to-night. Yours, ever, <char>PONNONNER</char>.</note>
    </p>

    <p n="6">By the time I had reached the "<char>Ponnonner</char>," it struck me that I was as wide awake as a
        man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing all in my way; dressed myself
        with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the
        <char>doctor's</char>.</p>

    <p n="7">There I found a very eager company assembled. <fos type="personification">They had been awaiting me with much
        impatience;</fos> the <char> Mummy</char> was extended upon the dining-table; and the moment I entered its
        examination was commenced.</p>

    <p n="8">It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by <char>Captain Arthur Sabretash,</char>
        a cousin of <char>Ponnonner's</char> from a tomb near Eleithias, in the Lybian mountains, a considerable
        distance above Thebes on the Nile. The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent
        than the Theban sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous
        illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from which our specimen was
        taken, was said to be very rich in such illustrations; the walls being completely covered
        with fresco paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich
        patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.</p>

    <p n="9">The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same condition in
        which<char> Captain Sabretash </char>had found it; -- that is to say, the coffin had not been disturbed.
        For eight years it had thus stood, subject only externally to public inspection. We had now,
        therefore, the complete <char> Mummy</char> at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely
        the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once that we had great
        reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.</p>

    <p n="10">Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet long, and
        perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was oblong -- not coffin-shaped.
        The material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore (platanus), but, upon
        cutting into it, we found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, papier mache, composed of
        papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing funeral scenes, and other
        mournful subjects -- interspersed among which, in every variety of position, were certain
        series of hieroglyphical chars, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. By
        good luck, <char> Mr. Gliddon</char> formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in translating the
        letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the word <char> Allamistakeo</char>.</p>

    <p n="11">We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but having at length
        accomplished the task, we came to a second, coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in
        size than the exterior one, but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The interval
        between the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the colors of the
        interior box.</p>

    <p n="12">Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a third case,
        also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no particular, except in that of its
        material, which was cedar, and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that
        wood. Between the second and the third case there was no interval -- the one fitting
        accurately within the other.</p>

    <p n="13">Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We had expected
        to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in place of
        these, we found a sort of sheath, made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster,
        thickly gilt and painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various
        supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities, with numerous
        identical human figures, intended, very probably, as portraits of the persons embalmed.
        Extending from head to foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic
        hieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his
        relations.</p>

    <p n="14">Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads, diverse in
        color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged
        globe. Around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt.</p>

    <p n="15">Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation, with no
        perceptible odor. The color was reddish. <fos type="imagery">The skin was hard, smooth, and glossy. The teeth
        and hair were in good condition. The eyes (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones
        substituted, which were very beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of
        somewhat too determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly
        gilded.</fos></p>

    <p n="16"><char> Mr. Gliddon</char> was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the embalmment
        had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the surface with a steel
        instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained, the flavor of
        camphor and other sweet-scented gums became apparent.</p>

    <p n="17">We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the
        entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none. No member of the party
        was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. The brain
        it was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the
        side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks, when
        the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.</p>

    <p n="18">As no trace of an opening could be found, <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char> was preparing his
        instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two o'clock. Hereupon it
        was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening; and we were about to
        separate for the present, when some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic
        pile.</p>

    <p n="19"><fos type="metaphor">The application of electricity to a <char> mummy</char> three or four thousand years old at the
        least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original, and we all caught it at
        once.</fos> About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the
        <char>Doctor's</char> study, and conveyed thither the Egyptian.</p>

    <p n="20">It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the
        temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame, but
        which, as we had anticipated, of course, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when
        brought in contact with the wire. <fos type="imagery">This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with
        a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night, when my eyes,
        happening to fall upon those of the <char> Mummy</char>, were there immediately riveted in amazement.</fos> My
        brief glance, in fact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to
        be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far
        covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea remained
        visible.</p>

    <p n="21">With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately obvious to
        all.</p>

    <p n="22">I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because "alarmed" is, in my case,
        not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for the Brown Stout, I might have
        been a little nervous. As for the rest of the company, they really made no attempt at
        concealing the downright fright which possessed them. <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char> was a man to be
        pitied. <char> Mr. Gliddon</char>, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. <char>Mr. Silk
        Buckingham</char>, I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his way, upon all
        fours, under the table.</p>

    <p n="23">After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter of course,
        upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now directed against the great toe of
        the right foot. We made an incision over the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis
        pedis, and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle. <fos type="simile">Readjusting the battery, we now
        applied the fluid to the bisected nerves -- when, with a movement of exceeding
        life-likeness, the <char> Mummy</char> first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact
        with the abdomen, and then, straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick
        upon <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char>, which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow
        from a catapult, through a window into the street below.</fos></p>

    <p n="24"><fos type="hyperbole">We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the
        happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry, brimful of
        the most ardent philosophy, and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting
        our experiment with vigor and with zeal.</fos></p>

    <p n="25">It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound incision
        into the tip of the subject's nose, while the <char>Doctor</char> himself, laying violent hands upon it,
        pulled it into vehement contact with the wire.</p>

    <p n="26"><fos type="personification">Morally and physically -- figuratively and literally -- was the effect electric. In
        the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes, as
        does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon
        end; in the fourth, it shook its fist in <char>Doctor Ponnonner's</char> face; in the fifth, turning to
        Messieurs<char>  Gliddon</char> and <char> Buckingham</char>, it addressed them, in very capital Egyptian,
        thus</fos>:</p>

    <p n="27">"I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at your
        behaviour. Of <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char> nothing better was to be expected. He is a poor little fat
        fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But you, <char> Mr. Gliddon</char>- and you, Silk -- who
        have travelled and resided in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born -- you, I
        say who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I think, as you
        write your mother tongue -- you, whom I have always been led to regard as the firm friend of
        the mummies -- I really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am I to think
        of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose by
        your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my clothes, in this
        wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the point) am I to regard your aiding and
        abetting that miserable little villain, <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char>, in pulling me by the
        nose?"</p>

    <p n="28">It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech under the
        circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into violent hysterics, or went off
        in a general swoon. One of these three things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each and
        all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my word, I
        am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other. <fos type="metaphor">But,
        perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age, which proceeds by the
        rule of contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in
        the way of paradox and impossibility. </fos>Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the <char>Mummy's</char>
        exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.
        However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party betrayed any very
        particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially
        wrong.</p>

    <p n="29">For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside, out of the
        range of the Egyptian's fist. <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char> thrust his hands into his breeches' pockets,
        looked hard at the <char> Mummy</char>, and grew excessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his
        whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt. <char> Mr. Buckingham</char> hung down his head, and put his
        right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p n="30">The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and at length,
        with a sneer, said:</p>

    <p n="31">"Why don't you speak, <char> Mr. Buckingham</char>? Did you hear what I asked you, or not? Do take
        your thumb out of your mouth!"</p>

    <p n="32"><char> Mr. Buckingham</char>, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of the left
        corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the right
        corner of the aperture above-mentioned.</p>

    <p n="33">Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly to<char> Mr.
        Gliddon, </char>and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant.</p>

    <p n="34"><char> Mr. Gliddon</char> replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the deficiency of
        American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would afford me much pleasure to record
        here, in the original, the whole of his very excellent speech.</p>

    <p n="35">I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent conversation in
        which the <char> Mummy</char> took a part, was carried on in primitive Egyptian, through the medium (so
        far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company) -- through the medium,
        I say, of Messieurs<char>  Gliddon</char> and <char> Buckingham</char>, as interpreters.<fos type="hyperbole"> These gentlemen spoke the
        mother tongue of the <char> Mummy</char> with inimitable fluency and grace; but I could not help observing
        that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modern, and, of course,
        entirely novel to the stranger) the two <char> travellers</char> were reduced, occasionally, to the
        employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. <char> Mr. Gliddon</char>,
        at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term "politics,"
        until he sketched upon the wall, with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman,
        out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown
        forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the mouth open at an
        angle of ninety degrees. </fos>Just in the same way <char> Mr. Buckingham</char> failed to convey the absolutely
        modern idea "wig," until (at <char>Doctor Ponnonner's</char> suggestion) he grew very pale in the face,
        and consented to take off his own.</p>

    <p n="36">It will be readily understood that <char> Mr. Gliddon</char>'s discourse turned chiefly upon the
        vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies;
        apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in
        particular, the individual <char> Mummy</char> called <char> Allamistakeo</char>; and concluding with a mere hint (for
        it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were now explained, it
        might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended. Here <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char> made
        ready his instruments.</p>

    <p n="37">In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that <char> Allamistakeo</char> had
        certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did not distinctly learn; but he
        expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table,
        shook hands with the company all round.</p>

    <p n="38">When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in repairing the
        damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We sewed up the wound in his
        temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square inch of black plaster to the tip of his
        nose.</p>

    <p n="39">It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of <char> Allamistakeo</char>)
        had a slight fit of shivering -- no doubt from the cold. The <char>Doctor</char> immediately repaired to
        his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black dress coat, made in Jennings' best manner, a
        pair of sky-blue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of
        brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,
        patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of whiskers, and a
        waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between the Count and the <char>doctor</char> (the
        proportion being as two to one), there was some little difficulty in adjusting these
        habiliments upon the person of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been
        said to be dressed. <char> Mr. Gliddon</char>, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a comfortable
        chair by the fire, while the <char>Doctor</char> rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of
        cigars and wine.</p>

    <p n="40">The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course, expressed in
        regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of <char>Allamistakeo's</char> still remaining alive.</p>

    <p n="41">"I should have thought," observed <char> Mr. Buckingham</char>, "that it is high time you were
        dead."</p>

    <p n="42">"Why," replied the Count, very much astonished, "I am little more than seven hundred
        years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means in his dotage when he
        died."</p>

    <p n="43">Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of which it became
        evident that the antiquity of the <char> Mummy</char> had been grossly misjudged. It had been five
        thousand and fifty years and some months since he had been consigned to the catacombs at
        Eleithias.</p>

    <p n="44">"But my remark," resumed <char> Mr. Buckingham</char>, "had no reference to your age at the period
        of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are still a young man), and my
        illusion was to the immensity of time during which, by your own showing, you must have been
        done up in asphaltum."</p>

    <p n="45">"In what?" said the Count.</p>

    <p n="46">"In asphaltum," persisted<char> Mr. B</char>.</p>

    <p n="47">"Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to answer, no
        doubt -- but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else than the Bichloride of
        Mercury."</p>

    <p n="48">"But what we are especially at a loss to understand," said <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char>, "is how
        it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt five thousand years ago, you are here
        to-day all alive and looking so delightfully well."</p>

    <p n="49">"Had I been, as you say, dead," replied the Count, "it is more than probable that
        dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the infancy of Calvanism, and cannot
        accomplish with it what was a common thing among us in the old days. But the fact is, I fell
        into catalepsy, and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should
        be; they accordingly embalmed me at once -- I presume you are aware of the chief principle
        of the embalming process?"</p>

    <p n="50">"Why not altogether."</p>

    <p n="51">"Why, I perceive -- a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot enter into
        details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm (properly speaking), in
        Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process. I use
        the word 'animal' in its widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and
        vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in the
        immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected
        to the process. To be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of
        embalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood
        of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present."</p>

    <p n="52">"The blood of the Scarabaeus!" exclaimed <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char>.</p>

    <p n="53">"Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the 'arms,' of a very distinguished and
        very rare patrician family. To be 'of the blood of the Scarabaeus,' is merely to be one of
        that family of which the Scarabaeus is the insignium. I speak figuratively."</p>

    <p n="54">"But what has this to do with you being alive?"</p>

    <p n="55">"Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before embalmment, of
        its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did not coincide with the custom. Had
        I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I should have been without bowels and brains; and without
        either it is inconvenient to live."</p>

    <p n="56">"I perceive that," said <char> Mr. Buckingham</char>, "and I presume that all the entire mummies
        that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei."</p>

    <p n="57">"Beyond doubt."</p>

    <p n="58">"I thought," said <char> Mr. Gliddon</char>, very meekly, "that the Scarabaeus was one of the
        Egyptian gods."</p>

    <p n="59">"One of the Egyptian what?" exclaimed the <char> Mummy</char>, starting to its feet.</p>

    <p n="60">"Gods!" repeated the <char> traveller</char>.</p>

    <p n="61">"<char> Mr. Gliddon</char>, I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style," said the Count,
        resuming his chair. "No nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged more than
        one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with
        others) the symbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to
        be more directly approached."</p>

    <p n="62">There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by<char> Doctor
        Ponnonner</char>.</p>

    <p n="63">"It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained," said he, "that among the
        catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the Scarabaeus tribe, in a
        condition of vitality?"</p>

    <p n="64">"There can be no question of it," replied the Count; "all the Scarabaei embalmed
        accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those purposely so embalmed, may have
        been overlooked by their executors, and still remain in the tomb."</p>

    <p n="65">"Will you be kind enough to explain," I said, "what you mean by 'purposely so
        embalmed'?"</p>

    <p n="66">"With great pleasure!" answered the <char> Mummy</char>, after surveying me leisurely through his
        eye-glass -- for it was the first time I had ventured to address him a direct
        question.</p>

    <p n="67">"With great pleasure," he said. <fos type="hyperbole">"The usual duration of man's life, in my time, was
        about eight hundred years.</fos> Few men died, unless by most extraordinary accident, before the
        age of six hundred; few lived longer than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered
        the natural term. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already
        described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might be
        gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of science much advanced, by living this
        natural term in installments. In the case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that
        something of this kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained the age
        of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully
        embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that they should cause him to be
        revivified after the lapse of a certain period -- say five or six hundred years.<fos type="metaphor"> Resuming
        existence at the expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work converted
        into a species of hap-hazard note-book -- that is to say, into a kind of literary arena for
        the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated
        commentators.</fos> These guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or
        emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the
        text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book. When
        discovered, it was never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout, it
        was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately in
        correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the traditions of the day
        concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived. Now this process of re-scription and
        personal rectification, pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the
        effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable."</p>

    <p n="68">"I beg your pardon," said <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char> at this point, laying his hand gently upon
        the arm of the Egyptian -- "I beg your pardon, sir, but may I presume to interrupt you for
        one moment?"</p>

    <p n="69">"By all means, sir," replied the Count, drawing up.</p>

    <p n="70">"I merely wished to ask you a question," said the <char>Doctor</char>. "You mentioned the
        historian's personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch. Pray, sir, upon an
        average what proportion of these Kabbala were usually found to be right?"</p>

    <p n="71">"The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to be
        precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written histories themselves; --
        that is to say, not one individual iota of either was ever known, under any circumstances,
        to be not totally and radically wrong."</p>

    <p n="72">"But since it is quite clear," resumed the <char>Doctor</char>, "that at least five thousand years
        have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted that your histories at that
        period, if not your traditions were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal
        interest, the Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten
        centuries before."</p>

    <p n="73">"Sir!" said the Count <char> Allamistakeo</char>.</p>

    <p n="74">The <char>Doctor</char> repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional explanation
        that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The latter at length said,
        hesitatingly:</p>

    <p n="75">"The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During my time I
        never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe (or this world if
        you will have it so) ever had a beginning at all. I remember once, and once only, hearing
        something remotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin of the human
        race; and by this individual, the very word Adam (or Red Earth), which you make use of, was
        employed.<fos type="metaphor"> He employed it, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous
        germination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are
        germinated) -- the spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men,
        simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the
        globe.</fos>"</p>

    <p n="76">Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of us touched
        our foreheads with a very significant air. <char> Mr. Silk Buckingham</char>, first glancing slightly at
        the occiput and then at the sinciput of <char> Allamistakeo</char>, spoke as follows:</p>

    <p n="77">"The long duration of human life in your time, together with the occasional practice
        of passing it, as you have explained, in installments, must have had, indeed, a strong
        tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore,
        that we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars of
        science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the Yankees, altogether to
        the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull."</p>

    <p n="78">"I confess again," replied the Count, with much suavity, "that I am somewhat at a
        loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science do you allude?"</p>

    <p n="79">Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the assumptions of
        phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.</p>

    <p n="80">Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes, which
        rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt
        so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really
        very contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban
        savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.</p>

    <p n="81">I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He smiled
        rather contemptuously, and said they were.</p>

    <p n="82">This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to his
        astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as yet opened his mouth,
        whispered in my ear, that for information on this head, I had better consult Ptolemy
        (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one Plutarch de facie lunae.</p>

    <p n="83">I then questioned the <char> Mummy</char> about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in general, about
        the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my queries before the silent member
        again touched me quietly on the elbow, and begged me for God's sake to take a peep at
        Diodorus Siculus. As for the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns
        possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of the
        Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this question, little <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char>
        committed himself in a very extraordinary way.</p>

    <p n="84">"Look at our architecture!" he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of both the
        <char> travellers</char>, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.</p>

    <p n="85">"Look," he cried with enthusiasm, "at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New York! or if
        this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the Capitol at Washington, D. C.!" --
        and the good little medical man went on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the
        fabric to which he referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less
        than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.</p>

    <p n="86">The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that moment, the
        precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of Aznac, whose
        foundations were laid in the night of Time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at
        the epoch of his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He
        recollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in
        a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven
        feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart.<fos type="hyperbole"> The approach to this portico, from the
        Nile, was through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks,
        twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height.</fos> The palace itself (as well as he could
        remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been altogether about seven
        in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics.
        He would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the <char>Doctor's</char> <fos type="hyperbole">Capitols might have
        been built within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred of them
        might not have been squeezed in with some trouble.</fos> That palace at Carnac was an
        insignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could not conscientiously
        refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling
        Green, as described by the <char>Doctor</char>. Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been
        seen in Egypt or elsewhere.</p>

    <p n="87">I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.</p>

    <p n="88">"Nothing," he replied, "in particular." They were rather slight, rather
        ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of course, with the
        vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which the Egyptians conveyed entire temples
        and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude.</p>

    <p n="89">I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.</p>

    <p n="90">He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should have gone to
        work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at
        Carnac.</p>

    <p n="91">This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of Artesian
        wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while <char> Mr. Gliddon</char> winked at me very hard and said,
        in a low tone, that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for
        water in the Great Oasis.</p>

    <p n="92">I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked me if our
        steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks, and which was wrought
        altogether by edge-tools of copper.</p>

    <p n="93">This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to
        Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the "Dial," and read out of it a chapter or
        two about something that is not very clear, but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement
        of Progress.</p>

    <p n="94">The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in his day, and
        as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it never progressed.</p>

    <p n="95">We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at much
        trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living
        where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.</p>

    <p n="96">He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused. When we had
        done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred something of a very similar sort.
        Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent
        example to the rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most
        ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed remarkably well;
        only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing ended, however, in the consolidation
        of the thirteen states, with some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and
        insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.</p>

    <p n="97">I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.</p>

    <p n="98">As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.</p>

    <p n="99">Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the Egyptian
        ignorance of steam.</p>

    <p n="100">The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. <fos type="metaphor">The silent
        gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows -- told me I had
        sufficiently exposed myself for once -- and demanded if I was really such a fool as not to
        know that the modern steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon de
        Caus</fos>.</p>

    <p n="101">We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck would have it,
        <char>Doctor Ponnonner</char>, having rallied, returned to our rescue, and inquired if the people of
        Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the all- important particular of
        dress.</p>

    <p n="102">The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and then taking
        hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some minutes.
        Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do
        not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply.</p>

    <p n="103">Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the <char>Doctor</char>, approaching the <char> Mummy</char> with great
        dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a gentleman, if the Egyptians had
        comprehended, at any period, the manufacture of either <char>Ponnonner's</char> lozenges or Brandreth's
        pills.</p>

    <p n="104">We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer -- but in vain. It was not
        forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was triumph more consummate;
        never was defeat borne with so ill a grace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle of the
        poor <char>Mummy's</char> mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took
        leave.</p>

    <p n="105">Upon getting home I found it past four o'clock, and went immediately to bed. It is
        now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these memoranda for the benefit of my
        family and of mankind. The former I shall behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The truth is,
        I am heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced
        that every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to know who will be President in
        2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step over to
        <char>Ponnonner's</char> and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years.</p>

        </info>
        
        <p n="1">
            The “Red Death” had long devastated the country No pestilence had
            ever been so fatal, or so hideous. <fos type="metaphor">Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the redness and the horror of blood.</fos> 
            <fos type="imagery">There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness,
                and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains
                upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,</fos> were the pest ban
            which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And
            the whole seizure, progress and termination of the disease, were the incidents
            of half an hour.</p>
        
        <p n="2">But the <char>Prince Prospero</char> was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his
            dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale
            and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and
            with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. <fos type="imagery">This
                was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince’s
                own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This
                wall had gates of iron.</fos> The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and
            massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of
            ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within.
            The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid
            defiance to contagion.<fos type="personification"> The external world could take care of itself.</fos> In the
            meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the
            appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there
            were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine.
            All these and security were within. Without was the “Red Death”.</p>
        
        <p n="3">It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and
            while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero
            entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual
            magnificence.</p>
        
        <p n="4">It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the rooms
            in which it was held. These were seven—an imperial suite. In many
            palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding
            doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the
            whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might
            have been expected from the duke’s love of the _bizarre_. The
            apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little
            more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty
            yards, and at each turn a novel effect.<fos type="imagery"> To the right and left, in the middle of
                each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor
                which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass
                whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of
                the chamber into which it opened. </fos>That at the eastern extremity was hung, <fos type="imagery">for
                    example in blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was
                    purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The
                    third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished
                    and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the sixth with violet.
                    The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung
                    all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet
                    of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the colour of the
                    windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were
                    scarlet—a deep blood colour. Now in no one of the seven apartments was
                    there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay
                    scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind
                    emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the
                    corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a
                    heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the
                    tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a
                    multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black
                    chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings
                    through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so
                    wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of
                    the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="5">It was in this apartment, also, <fos type="imagery">that there stood against the western wall, a
            gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy,
            monotonous clang;</fos> and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and
            the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a
            sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of so
            peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of
            the orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to
            harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions;
            and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the
            chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and
            the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused
            reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter
            at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as
            if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the
            other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar
            emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three
            thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet
            another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and
            tremulousness and meditation as before.</p>
        
        <p n="6">But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The tastes
            of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colours and effects. He
            disregarded the _decora_ of mere fashion. His plans were bold and fiery,
            and <fos type="personification">his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre.</fos> There are some who would have
            thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was necessary to hear
            and see and touch him to be _sure_ that he was not.</p>
        
        <p n="7">He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of the seven
            chambers, upon occasion of this great _fête_; and it was his own guiding
            taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were
            grotesque. <fos type="imagery">There were much glare and glitter and piquancy</fos> and
            phantasm—much of what has been since seen in “Hernani”. There
            were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were
            delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the
            beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the _bizarre_, something of the
            terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. <fos type="personification">To and fro
                in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And
                these—the dreams—writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms,
                and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.</fos>
            And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the
            velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice
            of the clock. <fos type="metaphor">The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.</fos> But the echoes of the
            chime die away—they have endured but an instant—and a light,
            half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music
            swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever,
            taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the
            tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are
            now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; <fos type="imagery">and there
                flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes; and the blackness of
                the sable drapery appals; </fos>and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet,
            there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic
            than any which reaches _their_ ears who indulged in the more remote
            gaieties of the other apartments.</p>
        
        <p n="8">But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly
            the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there
            commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased,
            as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was
            an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes
            to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that
            more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the
            thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that
            before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there
            were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the
            presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single
            individual before. And the rumour of this new presence having spread itself
            whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or
            murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of
            terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p>
        
        <p n="9">In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed
            that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the
            masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in
            question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the
            prince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most
            reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost,
            to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest
            can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the
            costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. <fos type="imagery">The
                figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of
                the grave. </fos>The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble
            the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had
            difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if
            not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to
            assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in
            _blood_—and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was
            besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>
        
        <p n="10">When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which, with
            a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to
            and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment
            with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow
            reddened with rage.</p>
        
        <p n="11"><conversation speaker="Prince_Prospero">“Who dares,”—he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood
            near him—“who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize
            him and unmask him—that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise,
            from the battlements!”</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="12">It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he
            uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly,
            for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at
            the waving of his hand.</p>
        
        <p n="13">It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers
            by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this
            group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at
            hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the
            speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the
            mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand
            to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince’s
            person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the
            centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with
            the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first,
            through the blue chamber to the purple—through the purple to the
            green—through the green to the orange—through this again to the
            white—and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made
            to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with
            rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the
            six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had
            seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid
            impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the
            latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly
            and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the dagger dropped
            gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell
            prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of
            despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black
            apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and
            motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror
            at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so
            violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p>
        
        <p n="14">And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. <fos type="simile">He had come like a
            thief in the night.</fos> And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed
            halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And
            the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. <fos type="personification">And the
                flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held
                illimitable dominion over all. </fos></p>

    <info pov="first person"><title>The Fall of the House of Usher </title>  <author>Edgar Allan Poe</author>

        <year>(published 1839)</year></info>

    <p n="1">DURING the whole of a <fos type="alliteration">dull, dark, and
            soundless</fos> day in the autumn of the year, <fos
            type="personification">when the clouds hung oppressively </fos> low in the
        heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of
        country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of
        the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it was --<fos type="hyperbole">but,
            with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my
            spirit.</fos> I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of
        that <fos type="irony">half-pleasurable, because poetic,
            sentiment,</fos> with which the mind usually receives even the sternest
        natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me --upon the
        mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain --upon the bleak walls --upon
        the vacant eye-like windows --upon a few rank sedges --and upon a few white trunks of
        decayed trees --with an utter depression of soul which <fos type="simile">I can
            compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller
            upon opium</fos> --the bitter lapse into everyday life --the hideous dropping
        off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart --an unredeemed
        dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the
        sublime. What was it --I paused to think --what was it that so unnerved me in the
        contemplation of <fos type="metaphor"><fos type="symbolism">the House of
                Usher?</fos></fos> It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I
        grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall
        back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of
        very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of
        this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a
        mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture,
        would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful
        impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a
        black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down --but with
        a <fos type="onomatopoeia">shudder</fos> even more thrilling than before
        --upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and
        the vacant and eye-like windows.</p>
    <p n="2">Nevertheless, in this <fos type="imagery">mansion of
            gloom</fos> I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor,
            <char>Roderick Usher</char>, had been one of my boon
        companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however,
        had lately reached me in a distant part of the country --a letter from him --which, in its
        wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave
        evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of <fos type="hyperbole">acute
            bodily illness</fos> --of a mental disorder which oppressed him --and of an
        earnest desire to see me, <fos type="irony">as his best, and indeed his only
            personal friend</fos>, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my
        society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more,
        was said <fos type="personification">--it the apparent heart that went with his
            request --</fos>which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly
        obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.</p>
    <p n="3">Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little
        of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that
        his very ancient family had been noted, <fos type="hyperbole">time out of
            mind</fos>, for a <fos type="alliteration">peculiar
            sensibility</fos> of temperament, displaying itself, through <fos
            type="hyperbole">long ages</fos>, in many works of exalted art, and
        manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of <fos type="irony">munificent yet
            unobtrusive charity</fos>, as well as in a <fos type="alliteration"
            >passionate devotion</fos> to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the
        orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very
        remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put
        forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the
        direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so
        lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect
        keeping of the char of <fos type="personification"> premises with the
            accredited char of the people</fos>, and while speculating upon the
        possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon
        the other --it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent
        undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at
        length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and
        equivocal appellation of the <fos type="metaphor">"House of Usher"</fos>
        --an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both
        the family and the family mansion.</p>
    <p n="4">I have said that the <fos type="hyperbole">sole effect of my somewhat
            childish experiment</fos> --that of looking down within the tarn --had been to
        deepen the first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the
        rapid increase of my superstition --for why should I not so term it? --served mainly to
        accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the <fos type="irony"
            >paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis.</fos> And it
        might have been for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house
        itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy --a fancy so
        ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which
        oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about
            <fos type="personification">the whole mansion and domain there hung an
            atmosphere peculiar to themselves</fos> and their immediate vicinity-an
        atmosphere <fos type="hyperbole">which had no affinity with the air of
            heaven</fos>, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray
        wall, and the silent tarn --a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly
        discernible, and leaden-hued.</p>
    <p n="5"><fos type="hyperbole">Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a
            dream</fos>, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.
            <fos type="hyperbole">Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive
            antiquity.</fos> The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi
        overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves.
            <fos type="irony">Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary
            dilapidation</fos>. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared
        to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling
        condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious
        totality of old wood-work <fos type="simile">which has rotted for long years in
            some neglected vault</fos>, with no disturbance from the breath of the
        external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, <fos
            type="personification">the fabric gave little token of instability.</fos>
        Perhaps <fos type="metaphor">the eye of a scrutinising <char
                >observer</char></fos> might have discovered a barely perceptible
        fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall
        in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the <fos type="onomatopoeia">sullen
            waters of <fos type="symbolism">the
        tarn.</fos></fos></p>
    <p n="6">Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in
        waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy
        step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my
        progress to the studio of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know
        not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects
        around me --while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon
        blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which <fos
            type="onomatopoeia">rattled as I strode</fos>, were but matters to which, or
        to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy --while I hesitated not to
        acknowledge how familiar was all this --I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the
        fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the
        physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low
        cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw
        open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.</p>
    <p n="7"><fos type="imagery">The room in which I found myself was very large and
            lofty. The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the
            black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within.</fos>
        <fos type="imagery">Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light</fos> made their
        way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more
        prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of
        the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. <fos
            type="imagery">Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,
            comfortless, antique, and tattered.</fos>
        <fos type="imagery">Many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but
            failed to give any vitality to the scene.</fos>
        <fos type="personification">I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.</fos>
        <fos type="symbolism">An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and
            pervaded all.</fos></p>
    <p n="8">Upon my entrance, <char>Usher</char> arose from a sofa on
        which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a <fos
            type="hyperbole">vivacious warmth</fos> which had much in it, I at first
        thought, of an <fos type="irony">overdone cordiality</fos> --of the
        constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance,
        convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke
        not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. <fos
            type="metaphor">Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period,
            as had Roderick Usher!</fos> It was with difficulty that I could bring myself
        to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.
            <fos type="imagery">Yet the char of his face had been at all times
            remarkable.</fos> A <fos type="imagery">cadaverousness of
            complexion</fos>; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips
        somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate
        Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded
        chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than
        web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the
        regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten.</p>
    <p n="9">In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an <fos
            type="alliteration">incoherence --an inconsistency</fos>; and I soon found
        this to arise from a series of feeble and futile <fos type="alliteration"
            >struggles</fos> to overcome an habitual trepidancy --an excessive nervous
        agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter,
        than by <fos type="imagery">reminiscences of certain boyish
        traits</fos>, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation
        and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and
            sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a <fos type="metaphor"
            >tremulous indecision</fos> (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in
        abeyance) to that species of energetic concision --that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and
        hollow-sounding enunciation --that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural
        utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium,
        during the periods of his most intense excitement.</p>
    <p n="10">It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see
        me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He entered, at some length, into what he
        conceived to be the nature of his malady.</p>
    <p n="11">It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he
        despaired to find a remedy --a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would
        undoubtedly soon pass off.</p>
    <p n="12">He suffered much from a <fos type="hyperbole">morbid acuteness of the
            senses</fos>; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only
        garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were
        tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed
        instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.</p>
    <p n="13">To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. <fos
            type="hyperbole">"I shall perish,"</fos> said he, <fos
            type="hyperbole">"I must perish in this deplorable folly."</fos>
        <fos type="metaphor">"Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be
            lost."</fos></p>
    <p n="14">I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. I
        shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this
        intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its
        absolute effect --in terror.</p>
    <p n="15"> In this <fos type="personification">unnerved-in this pitiable
            condition</fos> --I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when I
        must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm,
            <fos type="symbolism">FEAR.</fos>
    </p>
    <p n="16">I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints,
        another singular feature of his mental condition. He was <fos type="personification"
            >enchained</fos> by certain <fos type ="symbolism">superstitious impressions</fos> in
        regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured
        forth --in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too
        shadowy here to be re-stated --an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and
        substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his
        spirit-an effect which the <fos type ="imagery">physique of the gray walls and turrets</fos>, and of
        the <fos type ="symbolism">dim tarn</fos> into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought
        about upon the morale of his existence.</p>
    <p n="17">He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom
        which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more <fos type ="hyperbole">natural and far more palpable
            origin</fos> -- to the severe and long-continued illness -- indeed to the
        evidently approaching <fos type ="hyperbole">dissolution</fos> of a tenderly beloved <char
            >sister</char> -- his sole companion for long years -- his
        last and only relative on earth. <quote>"Her decease,"</quote> he said, with a
        bitterness which I can never forget, "would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the
        last of the ancient race of the Ushers." While he spoke, the <char
            >lady Madeline</char> (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote
        portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I regarded
        her with an utter <fos type ="imagery">astonishment not unmingled with dread</fos> --and yet I found
        it impossible to account for such feelings. <fos type ="imagery">A sensation of stupor oppressed
            me</fos>, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a door, at length, closed
        upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother --but he
        had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary
        wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate
        tears.</p>
    <p n="18">The disease of the <char>lady
            Madeline</char> had long baffled the skill of her physicians. A settled apathy,
        a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a
        partially cataleptical char, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily
        borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed;
        but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she <fos
            type="personification">succumbed</fos> (as her brother told me at night with
            <fos type="imagery">inexpressible agitation</fos>) to the
            <fos type="symbolism">prostrating power of the destroyer</fos>; and
        I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last I
        should obtain -- that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.</p>
    <p n="19">For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either<char
           >Usher</char> or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest
            <fos type="imagery">endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my
            friend</fos>. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream,
        to the wild improvisations of his <fos type="metaphor">speaking
            guitar.</fos> And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more
        unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility
        of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality,
        poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in <fos
            type="hyperbole">one unceasing radiation of gloom.</fos></p>
    <p n="20"><fos type="imagery">I shall ever bear about me a memory</fos>
        of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of <fos
            type="symbolism">the House of Usher.</fos> Yet I should fail in any attempt to
        convey an idea of the exact char of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he
        involved me, or led me the way.</p>
    <p n="21"> An <fos type="imagery">excited and highly distempered
            ideality</fos> threw a <fos type="imagery">sulphureous
            lustre</fos> over all. His <fos type="imagery">long improvised
            dirges</fos> will <fos type="hyperbole">ring forever in my
            ears</fos>. Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular
        perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of <char
            >Von Weber.</char> From the paintings over which his elaborate
        fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the
        more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why; --from these paintings (vivid as
        their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion
        which should lie within the compass of merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the
        nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an
        idea, that mortal was <char>Roderick Usher.</char> For me at
        least --in the circumstances then surrounding me --there arose out of the pure abstractions
        which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe,
        no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too
        concrete reveries of Fuseli.</p>
    <p n="22">One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of
        the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. <fos
            type="imagery">A small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and
            rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or
            device.</fos> Certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the
        idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No
        outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial
        source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and
            <fos type="imagery">bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate
            splendour.</fos></p>
    <p n="23">I have just spoken of that <fos type="hyperbole">morbid
            condition</fos> of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to
            <char>the sufferer,</char> with the exception of certain
        effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus
        confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the <fos
            type="symbolism">fantastic char of his performances</fos>. But the fervid
        facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. They must have been, and were, in
        the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently
        accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental
        collectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded as observable only in
        particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. The words of one of these
        rhapsodies I have easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as
        he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I
        perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, of the
        tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled "The Haunted
        Palace," ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:</p>
    <rhapsodie> I. In the greenest of our valleys, By good angels tenanted, Once fair and stately
        palace -- <fos type="imagery">Radiant palace</fos> --reared its head. In
        the monarch Thought's dominion -- It stood there! Never seraph spread a opinion Over fabric
        half so fair. II. Banners yellow, glorious, golden, On its roof did float and flow; (This
        --all this --was in the olden Time long ago) And every <fos type="personification"
            >gentle air that dallied,</fos> In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed
        and pallid, A winged odour went away. III. Wanderers in that <fos
            type="personification">happy valley</fos> Through two luminous windows saw
        Spirits moving musically To a lute's well-tuned law, Round about a throne, where sitting
        (Porphyrogene!) In state his glory well befitting, The ruler of the realm was seen. IV. And
        all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing,
        flowing, flowing And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing,
        In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king. V. But evil things, in
        robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch's high estate; (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow
        Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and
        bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed. VI. And travellers now
        within that valley, Through the red-litten windows, see Vast forms that move fantastically
        To a discordant melody; While, like a rapid ghastly river, Through the pale door, A hideous
        throng rush out forever, And laugh --but smile no more. </rhapsodie>
    <p n="24"> I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of
        thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of <char
            >Usher's</char> which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for
        other men have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it.
        This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But,
        in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring char, and trespassed, under
        certain conditions, upon the <fos type="symbolism">kingdom of
            inorganization.</fos> I lack words to express the full extent, or the
            <fos type="hyperbole">earnest abandon of his persuasion.</fos> The
        belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the
        home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined,
        fulfilled in the method of <fos type="imagery">collocation of these stones --in
            the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread
            them, and of the decayed trees which stood around --above all, in the long undisturbed
            endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the
            tarn.</fos>
        <quote>Its evidence --the evidence of the sentience --was to be seen,he said, (and I
            here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of
            their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable,</quote> he added,
        in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the
        destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him --what he was. Such opinions
        need no comment, and I will make none.</p>
    <p n="25">Our books --the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental
        existence of the invalid --were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this
            <fos type="metaphor">char of phantasm.</fos> We pored together
        over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the
        Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the
        Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indagine, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the
        Blue Distance of Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favourite volume was a
        small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne;
        and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrs and AEgipans, over
        which <fos type="hyperbole">Usher would sit dreaming for hours.</fos>
        His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book
        in quarto Gothic --the manual of a forgotten church --the Vigilae Mortuorum secundum Chorum
        Ecclesiae Maguntinae.</p>
    <p n="26">I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable
        influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the
            <char>lady Madeline</char> was no more, he stated
        his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment,)
        in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. The worldly reason,
        however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to
        dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the
        unusual char of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on
        the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of
        the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the
        person whom I met upon the stair case, on the day of my arrival at the house, <fos
            type="irony">I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by
            no means an unnatural, precaution.</fos></p>
    <p n="27">At the request of <char>Usher</char>, I personally aided
        him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we
        two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long
        unopened that our torches, half smothered in its <fos type="personification"
            >oppressive atmosphere,</fos> gave us little opportunity for investigation)
        was <fos type="imagery">small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for
            light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which
            was my own sleeping apartment.</fos> It had been used, apparently, in remote
        feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of
        deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,
        and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully
        sheathed with copper. <fos type="imagery">The door, of massive iron, had been,
            also, similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound,
            as it moved upon its hinges.</fos></p>
    <p n="28">
        <fos type="metaphor"><fos type="personification">Having deposited our
                mournful burden upon tressels within this region of
            horror,</fos></fos> we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid
        of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between the
        brother and sister now first <fos type="metaphor">arrested my
            attention</fos>; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some
        few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that
        sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. Our glances,
        however, rested not long upon the dead --for we could not regard her unawed. <fos
            type="metaphor">The disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth,
            had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical char,</fos>
        <fos type="personification">the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the
            face</fos>, and that <fos type="hyperbole">suspiciously lingering
            smile</fos> upon the lip which is so terrible in death. <fos
            type="imagery">We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of
            iron, made our way, with toll, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper
            portion of the house. </fos></p>
    <p n="29">And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over
        the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His ordinary manner had vanished. His
        ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. <fos type="hyperbole">He roamed
            from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.</fos> The
        pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue --but the
        luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. <fos type="imagery">The once
            occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of
            extreme terror, habitually charized his utterance.</fos> There were
        times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some
        oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. <fos
            type="hyperbole">At times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere
            inexplicable vagaries of madness,</fos> for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy
        for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some
        imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified-that it infected me. I felt
        creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet
        impressive superstitions.</p>
    <p n="30">It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or
        eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the donjon, that I experienced the
        full power of such feelings. <fos type="personification">Sleep came not near my
            couch --while the hours waned and waned away.</fos> I struggled to reason off
        the <fos type="personification">nervousness which had dominion over
            me.</fos> I endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was
        due to the bewildering influence of the <fos type="personification">gloomy
            furniture</fos> of the room --of the dark and tattered draperies, which,
        <fos type="personification">tortured into motion</fos> by the breath
        of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about
        the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. <fos type="metaphor">An
            irrepressible tremour gradually pervaded my frame;</fos> and, at length, there
        sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp
        and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the
        intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened --I know not why, except that an instinctive
        spirit prompted me --to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of
        the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of
        horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I
        should sleep no more during the night), and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable
        condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the
        apartment.</p>
    <p n="31">I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining
        staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as that of <char
           >Usher.</char><fos type="imagery"> In an instant afterward he
            rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.</fos>

        anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his
        presence as a relief.</p>
    <p n="32"><quote>And you have not seen it?" he said abruptly, after having stared
            about him for some moments in silence --"you have not then seen it? --but, stay! you
            shall." Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the
            casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.</quote></p>
    <p n="33">The <fos type="hyperbole">impetuous furyof the entering gust nearly

        <fos type="imagery">It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and

        hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the
        life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other,
        without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did not
        prevent our perceiving this --yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars --nor was there any

            as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural
            light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about
            and enshrouded the mansion.</fos></p>
    <p n="34">
        <quote>You must not --you shall not behold this!" said I, shudderingly, to
                <char>Usher</char>, as I led him, with a gentle violence,
            from the window to a seat. "These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical
            phenomena not uncommon --or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank
            miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement; --the air is chilling and dangerous to
            your frame. Here is one of your favourite romances. I will read, and you shall listen;
            --and so we will pass away this terrible night together."</quote></p>
    <p n="35">The antique volume which I had taken up was the <quote>Mad Trist"</quote>
        of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favourite of <char
            >Usher's</char> more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in
        its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and
        spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I
        indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find
        relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the
        extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by <fos type ="personification">
        the wild over-strained air</fos> of vivacity with which
        he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have
        congratulated myself upon the success of my design.</p>
    <p n="36">I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where <char>Ethelred,</char> the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain
        for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance
        by force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:</p>
    <p n="37">
        <quote>"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a <fos type="metaphor">doughty
                heart</fos>, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness
            of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold <fos
                type="symbolism">parley with the hermit,</fos> who, in sooth, was of an
            obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the
            rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in
            the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling there-with sturdily,
            he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, <fos type="imagery">that the
                noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the
                forest."</fos></quote></p>
    <p n="38">At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused; for it
        appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me) --it
        appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, <fos
            type="hyperbole">there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have
            been,</fos> in its exact similarity of char, the echo (but a stifled and
        dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which <char>Sir Launcelot</char> had so particularly described. It
        was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had <fos type="metaphor">arrested
            my attention</fos>; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and
        the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had
        nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the story:</p>
    <p n="39">
        <quote>"But the good champion <char
                >Ethelred</char>, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed
            to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, <fos
                type="imagery">a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue,
                which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the
                wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend</fos> enwritten
            --</quote></p>
    <p n="40">Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin; Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he
        shall win.</p>
    <p n="41"><quote>And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the
            dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and
            harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands
            against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before
        heard."</quote></p>
    <p n="42">Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement --for
        there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, I did actually hear (although from
        what direction it proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but
        harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound --the exact counterpart of
        what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the
        romancer.</p>
    <p n="43">Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most
        extraordinary coincidence, by <fos type="hyperbole">a thousand conflicting
            sensations,</fos> in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still
        retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive
        nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in
        question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken
        place in his demeanour. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his
        chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I could but partially
        perceive his features, although I saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring
        inaudibly. His head had dropped upon his breast --yet I knew that he was not asleep, from
        the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile. The motion of
        his body, too, was at variance with this idea --for he rocked from side to side with a
        gentle yet constant and uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the
        narrative of <char>Sir Launcelot</char>, which thus
        proceeded:</p>
    <p n="44">
        <quote>"And now, <fos type="imagery">the champion, having escaped from the
                terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the
                breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of
                the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle
                to where the shield was upon the wall</fos>; which in sooth tarried not
            for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty
            great and terrible ringing sound."</quote></p>
    <p n="45">No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than --as if a shield of brass had
        indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver, <fos type="imagery">
            became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled
            reverberation.</fos> Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the
        measured rocking movement of <char>Usher</char> was undisturbed. I
        rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout
        his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his
        shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about
        his lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious
        of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his
        words.</p>
    <p n="46">
        <quote>"Not hear it? --yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long --long --long --many
            minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it --yet I dared not --oh, pity me,
            miserable wretch that I am! --I dared not --I dared not speak! We have put her living in
            the tomb! Said I not that my senses were acute? I now tell you that I heard her first
            feeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them --many, many days ago --yet I dared
            not --I dared not speak! And now --to-night --Ethelred --ha! ha! --the breaking of the
            hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield! --say,
            rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and
            her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly? Will she
            not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her
            footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her
            heart? MADMAN!"</quote> here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his
        syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul --<quote>MADMAN! I TELL
            YOU THAT SHE NOW STANDS WITHOUT THE DOOR!"</quote></p>
    <p n="47">
        <fos type="hyperbole">As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had
            been found the potency of a spell</fos> --the huge antique panels to which the
        speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, ponderous and ebony jaws. It was the
            <fos type="personification">work of the rushing gust</fos> --but
        then without those doors there DID stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the <char

            >There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon

        inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore
        him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.</p>
    <p n="48">From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was still
        abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old causeway. Suddenly there shot
        along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have
        issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of
        the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once
        barely-discernible fissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roof of the
        building, in a zig-zag direction, to the base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened
        --there came a <fos type="personification">fierce breath of the

        <p n="1">IT was well said of a certain German book that <quote >"er lasst sich nicht lesen" </quote>--it does not permit itself to be read. There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. <fos type ="imagery">Men die nightly in their beds, wringing the hands of <fos type ="hyperbole">ghostly confessors,</fos> and looking them piteously in the eyes --die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed.</fos> Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.</p>
        
        <p n="2">Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat at the large bow window of the D__ Coffee-House in London. For some months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui --moods of the keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs --the xxxxx xx  xxxx xxxx [Greek text] --and the intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias.<fos type ="imagery"> Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain. I felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing. With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="3">This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had been very much crowded during the whole day. But, as the darkness came on, <fos type ="personification">the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door.</fos> At this particular period of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation, and the <fos type ="imagery">tumultuous sea of human heads filled me</fos>, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. I gave up, at length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without.</p>
        
        <p n="4">At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. I looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate relations. <fos type ="imagery">Soon, however, I descended to details, and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage, and expression of countenance.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="5">By far the greater number of those who went by had a <fos type = "simile">satisfied business-like demeanor</fos>, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press. <fos type ="imagery">Their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others, still a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion. --There was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I have noted. Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent. They were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers --the Eupatrids and the common-places of society --men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own --conducting business upon their own responsibility. They did not greatly excite my attention.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="6">The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable divisions. <fos type ="imagery">There were the junior clerks of flash houses --young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and supercilious lips.</fos> Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. They wore the cast-off graces of the gentry; --and this, I believe, involves the best definition of the class.</p>
        
        <p n="7">The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the <quote >"steady old fellows,"</quote> it was not possible to mistake. <fos type ="imagery">These were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or gaiters. --They had all slightly bald heads, from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end.</fos> I observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern. Theirs was the <fos type ="symbolism">affectation of respectability;</fos> --if indeed there be an affectation so honorable.</p>
        
        <p n="8">There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I easily understood as belonging to the race of <fos type = "hyperbole">swell pick-pockets</fos>, with which all great cities are infested. I watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves.Their voluminousness of wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once.</p>
        
        <p n="9">The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more easily recognisable. <fos type ="imagery">They wore every variety of dress, from that of the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief, gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. Still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. There were two other traits, moreover, by which I could always detect them; --a guarded lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.</fos> -- Very often, in company with these sharpers, <fos type ="metaphor">I observed an order of men somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather.</fos> They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. They seem to prey upon the public in two battalions --that of the dandies and that of the military men. Of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles; of the second frogged coats and frowns.</p>
        
        <p n="10">Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, <fos type ="imagery">I found darker and deeper themes for speculation. I saw Jew pedlars, with <fos type ="metaphor">hawk eyes</fos> flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost hope;</fos> modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided; <fos type ="metaphor">women of the town of all kinds and of all ages --the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with filth --the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags --the wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at youth --the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice;</fos> <fos type ="imagery">drunkards innumerable and indescribable -- some in shreds and patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes -- some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces --others clothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well brushed --men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd,</fos> at every object which came within their reach; beside these,<fos type ="hyperbole"> pie-men, porters, coal- heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers,</fos> those who vended with those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all full of <fos type ="hyperbole">a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="11">As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief, as the <fos type ="symbolism">late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,)</fos> but the <fos type ="imagery"><fos type ="personification">rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre.</fos> All was dark yet splendid --as that ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="12">The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of long years.</p>
        
        <p n="13">With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob, when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,) --a countenance <fos type ="hyperbole">which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression.</fos> Any thing even remotely resembling that expression I had never seen before. I well remember that my first thought, upon beholding it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it, would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend. As I endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, <fos type ="imagery">there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood-thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense --of supreme despair. I felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated.</fos> <quote >"How wild a history," I said to myself, "is written within that bosom!"</quote> Then came a craving desire to keep the man in view --to know more of him. Hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. With some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention.</p>
        
        <p n="14">I had now a good opportunity of examining his person. <fos type ="imagery">He was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. His clothes, generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped him,</fos> I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. These observations heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go.</p>
        
        <p n="15"><fos type ="imagery">It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain.</fos> This change of weather had an odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new commotion, and <fos type = "hyperbole">overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree.</fos> For my own part I did not much regard the rain --the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and bye he passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than before --more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. <fos type ="imagery">The street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the Park --so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that of the most frequented American city.</fos> A <fos type ="imagery">second turn brought us into a square, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life.</fos> The old manner of the stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times --once nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement.</p>
        
        <p n="16">In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first. <fos type ="imagery">The rain fell fast; the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes.With a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a bye-street comparatively deserted. Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an activity</fos> <fos type ="hyperbole"> I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit.</fos> <fos type ="imagery">A few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and sellers.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="17">During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation. Luckily <fos type ="hyperbole">I wore a pair of caoutchouc over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence.</fos> At no moment did he see that I watched him. He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. I was now utterly amazed at his behaviour, and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him.</p>
        
        <p n="18">A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the bazaar. A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame. He hurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started -- the street of the D__ Hotel. It no longer wore, however, the same aspect. <fos type ="imagery">It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen.</fos> The stranger grew pale. He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience --but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions.</p>
        
        <p n="19">As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed. For some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped off, until three only remained together, in a <fos type ="imagery">narrow and gloomy lane little frequented.</fos> The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed. <fos type ="imagery">It was the most noisome quarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the <fos type ="hyperbole">most deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime.</fos> By the dim light of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall,</fos> in directions so many and capricious that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass. Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death-hour. Once more he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, <fos type ="hyperbole">a blaze of light burst upon our sight,</fos> and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance --one of the palaces of the fiend, Gin.</p>
        
        <p n="20">It was now nearly day-break; but a number of <fos type ="metaphor">wretched inebriates</fos> still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. With a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among the throng. He had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. It was something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously. Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty London. Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing. The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the D__ Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before. And here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit of the stranger. But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street. And, as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation. This old man,<quote >" I said at length, "is the type and the genius of deep crime. He refuses to be alone. He is the man of the crowd. It will be in vain to follow; for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the 'Hortulus Animæ,' * and perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God that 'er lasst sich nicht lesen.'

            <title>The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar</title>
            <author>by Edgar Allan Poe</author>
            <year>(published 1845)</year>
        </info>
        
        <p n="1"> Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It would have been a miracle had it not -- especially under the circumstances. Through the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from the public, at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunities for investigation -- through our endeavors to effect this -- a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very naturally, of a great deal of disbelief.</p>
        
        <p n="2">  It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts -- as far as I comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:</p>
        
        <p n="3">  My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago, it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission: no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained, but these most excited my curiosity -- the last in especial, from the immensely important character of its consequences.</p>
        
        <p n="4">  In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the "Bibliotheca Forensica," and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of "Wallenstein" and"Gargantua." M. Valdemar, who has resided principally at Harlem, N. Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person -- his lower limbs much resembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair -- the latter, in consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.</p>
        
        <p n="5">  When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him; and he had no relatives in America who would be likely to interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited. I say to my surprise; for, although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments, he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease.</p>
        
        <p n="6">  It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M. Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:</p>
        <p n="7"><note from="M_Valdemar">"MY DEAR P___, You may as well come now. D___ and F___ are agreed that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very nearly.
            VALDEMAR."  
        </note></p>
        <p n="8">
            I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber. I had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him. <fos type="imagery">His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme, that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones.</fos> His expectoration was excessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength. He spoke with distinctness -- took some palliative medicines without aid -- and, when I entered the room, was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by pillows. Doctors D___ and F___ were in attendance.</p>
        
        <p n="9">  After pressing Valdemar's hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and obtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition. The left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into another. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date. The ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no sign of it had discovered a month before, and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days. Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday.) It was then seven o'clock on Saturday evening.</p>
        
        <p n="10">  On quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself, Doctors D___ and F___ had bidden him a final farewell. It had not been their intention to return; but, at my request, they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.</p>
        
        <p n="11">  When they had gone, I spoke freely with <char>M. Valdemar</char> on the subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the experiment proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male and a female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove. I therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when the arrival of a medical student, with whom I had some acquaintance, (<char>Mr. Theodore L___l</char>,) relieved me from farther embarrassment. It had been my design, originally, to wait for the physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.</p>
        
        <p n="12">  <char>Mr. L___l</char> was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred; and it is from his memoranda that what I now have to relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.</p>
        
        <p n="13">  It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L___l, whether he (M. Valdemar,) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.</p>
        
        <p n="14">  He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, <conversation speaker="M_Valdemar">"Yes, I wish to be mesmerized"</conversation> -- adding immediately afterwards, <conversation speaker="M_Valdemar">"I fear you have deferred it too long."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="15">  While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I exerted all my powers, no farther perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o'clock, when Doctors D___ and F___ called, according to appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I designed, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was already in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation -- exchanging, however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.</p>
        
        <p n="16">  By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.</p>
        
        <p n="17">  This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing ceased -- that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the intervals were undiminished. The patient's extremities were of an icy coldness.</p>
        
        <p n="18">  At five minutes before eleven, I perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence. <fos type="imagery">The glassy roll of the eye</fos> was changed for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake. With a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient sleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was not satisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulations vigorously, and <fos type="personification">with the fullest exertion of the will</fos>, until I had <fos type="hyperbole">completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer</fos>, after placing them in a seemingly easy position. <fos type="imagery">The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loins. The head was very slightly elevated.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="19">  When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested the gentlemen present to examine <char>M. Valdemar's</char> condition. After a few experiments, they admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited. <char>Dr. D___</char> resolved at once to remain with the patient all night, while Dr. F___ took leave with a promise to return at daybreak. Mr. L___l and the nurses remained.</p>
        
        <p n="20">  We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when Dr. F___ went away -- that is to say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the lips;) the eyes were closed naturally; and <fos type="simile">the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble.</fos> Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of death.</p>
        
        <p n="21">  As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently to and fro above his person. In such experiments with this patient, I had never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to hazard a few words of conversation.</p>
        
        <p n="22">  <conversation speaker="Narrator">"M. Valdemar,"</conversation> I said, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"are you asleep?"</conversation> He made no answer, but I perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eye-lids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:</p>
        
        <p n="23">  <conversation speaker="M_Valdemar">"Yes; asleep now. Do not wake me! -- let me die so!"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="24">  I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm, as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-waker again:</p>
        
        <p n="25">  <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="26">  The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:</p>
        
        <p n="27">  <conversation speaker="Narrator">"No pain -- I am dying."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="28">  I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F___, who came a little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I did so, saying:</p>
        
        <p n="29">  <conversation speaker="Narrator">"M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="30">  As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak. At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost inaudibly:</p>
        
        <p n="31">  <conversation speaker="M_Valdemar">"Yes; still asleep -- dying."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="32">  It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene -- and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. I concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my previous question.</p>
        
        <p n="33">  While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip, at the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.</p>
        
        <p n="34">  I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business, however, simply to proceed.</p>
        
        <p n="35">  There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue. This continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period, there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice -- such as it would be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation -- as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the voice seemed to reach our ears -- at least mine -- from a vast distance, or <fos type="metaphor">from some deep cavern within the earth.</fos> In the second place, it impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch.</p>
        
        <p n="36">  I have spoken both of "sound"and of "voice." I mean to say that the sound was one of distinct -- of even wonderfully, thrillingly distinct -- syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke -- obviously in reply to the question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him, it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:</p>
        
        <p n="37">  <conversation speaker="M_Valdemar">"Yes; -- no; -- I have been sleeping -- and now -- now -- I am dead."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="38">  No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were so well calculated to convey. Mr. L___l (the student) swooned. The nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return. My own impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader. For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently -- without the utterance of a word -- in endeavors to revive Mr. L___l. When he came to himself, we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar's condition.</p>
        
        <p n="39">  It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient volition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible -- although I endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker's state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock I left the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L___l.</p>
        
        <p n="40">  In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing. It was evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy dissolution.</p>
        
        <p n="41">  From this period until the close of last week -- an interval of nearly seven months -- we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this time the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him. The nurses' attentions were continual.</p>
        
        <p n="42">  It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles -- to so much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.</p>
        
        <p n="43">  For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I made use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful. The first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the iris. It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.</p>
        
        <p n="44">  It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient's arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F___ then intimated a desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:</p>
        
        <p n="45">  <conversation speaker="Narrator">"M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="46">  There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; <fos type="personification">the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth</fos> (although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length the same hideous voice which I have already described, broke forth:</p>
        
        <p n="47">  <conversation speaker="M_Valdemar">"For God's sake! -- quick! -- quick! -- put me to sleep -- or, quick! -- waken me! -- quick! -- I say to you that I am dead!"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="48">  I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to do. At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful -- or at least I soon fancied that my success would be complete -- and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.</p>
        
        <p n="49">  For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared.</p>
        
        <p n="50">  As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of <conversation speaker="M_Valdemar">"dead! dead!"</conversation> absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once -- within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk -- crumbled -- absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome -- of detestable putridity. </p>

        <p n="1">IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses -- of the <fos type ="symbolism">prima mobilia</fos> of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them. In the <fos type ="personification">pure arrogance of the reason</fos>, we have all overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want of belief -- of faith; -- whether it be <fos type ="symbolism">faith in Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala.</fos> <fos type ="irony">The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its supererogation.</fos> We saw no need of the impulse -- for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself; -- we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs -- to dictate purposes to <char>God</char>. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the <char>Deity</char> that man should eat. We then assigned to man an <fos type ="symbolism">organ of alimentiveness</fos>, and this organ is the scourge with which the <char>Deity</char> compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be <char>God's</char> will that man should continue his species, we discovered an <fos type ="symbolism">organ of amativeness, forthwith.</fos> And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness, -- so, in short, with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.</p >
        
        <p n="2">It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the <char>Deity</char> intended him to do. If we cannot comprehend <char >God</char> in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his <fos type = "personification">substantive moods and phases of creation?</fos></p >
        
        <p n="3">Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a <fos type ="symbolism">p doxical something, which we may call perverseness,</fos> for want of a more charistic term. In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a <fos type ="simile">mobile without motive</fos>, a motive not motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not. In theory, no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes <fos type ="hyperbole">absolutely irresistible.</fos> I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us, and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive impulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a glance will show the <fos type ="irony">fallacy</fos> of this idea. The phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term <fos type ="symbolism">perverseness</fos>, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly <fos type ="personification">antagonistical sentiment</fos> exists.</p >
        
        <p n="4">An <fos type ="symbolism">appeal to one's own heart</fos> is, after all, the best reply to the sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an <fos type ="personification">earnest desire</fos> to tantalize a listener by circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the <fos type ="hyperbole">most laconic and luminous language</fos> is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an <fos type ="hyperbole">uncontrollable longing</fos>, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.</p >
        
        <p n="5">We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole <fos type ="hyperbole">souls are on fire.</fos> It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why? There is no answer, except that we feel <fos type ="symbolism">perverse</fos>, using the word with no comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the <fos type ="metaphor">moments fly.</fos> The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us, -- of the definite with the indefinite -- of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the <fos type ="personification">shadow which prevails</fos>, -- <fos type ="hyperbole">we struggle in vain.</fos> The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the <char>chanticleer</char> -- note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It flies -- it disappears -- we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor now. Alas, it is too late! </p >
        
        <p n="6"><fos type ="imagery">We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss -- we grow sick and dizzy.</fos> Our first impulse is to <fos type ="hyperbole">shrink from the danger.</fos> Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged <fos type ="personification">in a cloud of unnamable feeling.</fos> By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one <fos type ="imagery">which chills the very marrow of our bones</fos> with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height. And this fall -- this  <fos type ="personification">rushing annihilation</fos> -- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination -- for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to <fos type ="imagery">prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.</fos></p >
        
        <p n="7">Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from the <fos type ="symbolism">spirit of the Perverse</fos>. We perpetrate them because we feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.</p >
        
        <p n="8">I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have <fos type ="hyperbole">fancied me mad.</fos> As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the <fos type="symbolism">Imp of the Perverse.</fos></p >
        
        <p n="9">It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to <char>Madame Pilau,</char> through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habit of reading in bed. I knew, too, that his <fos type ="imagery">apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated.</fos> But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the Coroner's verdict was -- "Death by the visitation of God."</p >
        
        <p n="10">Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea of detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left <fos type="personification">no shadow of a clew</fos> by which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of <fos type="personification">satisfaction arose in my bosom</fos> as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, <fos type ="imagery">from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.</fos> Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, "I am safe."</p >
        
        <p n="11">One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of petulance, I remodelled them thus; "I am safe -- I am safe -- yes -- if I be not fool enough to make open confession!"</p >
        
        <p n="12">No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an <fos type ="hyperbole">icy chill creep to my heart.</fos> I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, <fos type ="hyperbole">as if the very ghost of him whom I had murdered -- and beckoned me on to death.</fos></p >
        
        <p n="13">At first, I made an effort to shake off this <fos type ="simile">nightmare of the soul.</fos> <fos type ="imagery">I walked vigorously -- faster -- still faster -- at length I ran. I felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud.</fos> Every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my pace. I bounded <fos type ="simile">like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.</fos> At length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the <fos type ="simile">consummation of my fate.</fos> <fos type ="imagery"> Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears -- a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I turned -- I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.</fos></p >
        
        <p n="14"><fos type ="imagery">They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief,</fos> <fos type = "personification">but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.</fos>
            
            Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.
            
            But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am here! To-morrow I shall be fetterless! -- but where?</p >

        <p n="1"><char>LA MUSIQUE,"</char> says Marmontel, in those <quote>Contes Moraux"*</quote> which in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling <quote>"Moral Tales,"</quote> as if in <fos type ="hyperbole">mockery of their spirit</fos> -- <quote>"la musique est le seul des talents qui jouissent de lui-meme; tous les autres veulent des temoins."</quote> <fos type ="imagery">He here confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them.</fos> No more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one -- which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the presence -- not of human life only, but of life in any other form than that of the <fos type ="personification">green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless</fos> -- is a stain upon the landscape -- <fos type ="hyperbole">is at war with the genius of the scene.</fos> I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the <fos type ="personification">waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,</fos> -- <fos type ="hyperbole">I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole -- a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain -- a being which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="2">* Moraux is here derived from moeurs, and its meaning is <quote>"fashionable"</quote> or more strictly <quote>"of manners."</quote>
            
            Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand -- notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood -- that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. <fos type ="imagery">The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter; -- while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it.</fos> And since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle -- indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the operations of Deity, -- it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find <fos type ="symbolism">cycle within cycle without end, -- yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the God-head,</fos> may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are <fos type ="hyperbole">madly erring, through self-esteem,</fos> in believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast "clod of the valley" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation.*</p>
        
        <p n="3">* Speaking of the tides, <char>Pomponius Mela</char>, in his treatise De Situ Orbis, says <quote>"either the world is a great animal, or"</quote> etc.
            
            <fos type ="imagery">These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim, deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed and gazed alone.</fos> What <char>flippant Frenchman</char> was it who said in allusion to the well-known work of  <char>Zimmerman</char>, that, <quote>"la solitude est une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle chose?"</quote> The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist.</p>
        
        <p n="4">It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain, and <fos type ="personification">sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all</fos> -- that I chanced upon a certain rivulet and island. <fos type="imagery">I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look upon it -- such was the char of phantasm which it wore.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="5"><fos type="imagery">On all sides -- save to the west, where the sun was about sinking -- arose the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have <fos type ="personification">no exit from its prison</fos>, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east -- while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="6"><fos type ="imagery">About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.
            
            So blended bank and shadow there</fos>
            
            That each seemed pendulous in air -- so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began.
            
            My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked difference in their aspects. <fos type ="imagery">The latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful, erect -- bright, slender, and graceful, -- of eastern figure and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored.</fos> There seemed a deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from out the heavens, <fos type ="hyperbole">yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.</fos>*</p>
        
        <p n="7">* <quote>Florem putares nare per liquidum aethera.</quote> -- <char>P. Commire.</char>
            
            <fos type ="imagery">The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things.</fos>  <fos type = "personification">The trees were dark in color,and mournful in form and attitude, wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered.</fos>  <fos type ="imagery">The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness.</fos> I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself sullenly from the  <fos type = "personification">trunk that gave it birth</fos>, and thus became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed.</p>
        
        <p n="8">This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I lost myself forthwith in revery. "If ever island were enchanted," said I to myself, "this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle <char>Fays</char> who remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs? -- or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto <char>>God</char>, little by little, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, <fos type ="symbolism">growing thus blacker by what it preys upon</fos>, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?"</p>
        
        <p n="9">As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes,  <fos type ="imagery">while the sun sank rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the sycamore-flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased, while I thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island.</fos> She stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed indicative of joy -- but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. <quote>"The revolution which has just been made by the <char>Fay</char>," continued I, musingly, "is the cycle of the brief year of her life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She is a year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was <fos type ="symbolism">swallowed up in the dark water, making its blackness more black.</fos>"</quote></p>
        
        <p n="10">And again the boat appeared and the <char>Fay</char>, but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy. <fos type ="imagery">She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and became absorbed into its blackness.</fos><fos type ="imagery"> And again and again she made the circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person, while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more black.</fos> But at length when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now the <fos type ="metaphor">mere ghost of her former self</fos>, went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over an things and I beheld her magical figure no more.</p>

            <title>The Oblong Box</title>
            <author>by Edgar Allan Poe</author>
            <year>(published 1844)</year>
        </info>
        <p n="1">
            Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C, to the city of New York, in the fine packet-ship <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"Independence,"</conversation> <char>Captain Hardy</char>. We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (June), weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, I went on board to arrange some matters in my stateroom.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            I found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more than usual number of ladies. On the list were several of my acquaintances, and among other names, I was rejoiced to see that of <char>Mr. Cornelius Wyatt</char>, a young artist, for whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship. He had been with me a fellow-student at C—— University, where we were very much together. He had the ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. To these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            I observed that his name was carded upon THREE state-rooms; and, upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters—his own. The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other. These berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person; still, I could not comprehend why there were THREE staterooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary stateroom. It was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma. At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not arrived at it before. <conversation speaker="Narrator">"It is a servant of course,"</conversation> I said; <conversation speaker="Narrator">"what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution!"</conversation> And then I again repaired to the list—but here I saw distinctly that NO servant was to come with the party, although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring one—for the words <conversation speaker="Narrator">"and servant"</conversation> had been first written and then over-scored. <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Oh, extra baggage, to be sure,"</conversation> I now said to myself—<conversation speaker="Narrator">"something he wishes not to be put in the hold—something to be kept under his own eye—ah, I have it—a painting or so—and this is what he has been bargaining about with <char>Nicolino</char>, the Italian Jew."</conversation> This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            <char>Wyatt</char>'s two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls they were. His wife he had newly married, and I had never yet seen her. He had often talked about her in my presence, however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. He described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment. I was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            On the day in which I visited the ship (the fourteenth), <char>Wyatt</char> and party were also to visit it—so the <char>Captain Hardy</char> informed me—and I waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of being presented to the bride, but then an apology came. <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"Mrs. W. was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="6">
            The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the wharf, when <char>Captain Hardy</char> met me and said that, <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"owing to circumstances"</conversation> (a stupid but convenient phrase), <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"he rather thought the 'Independence' would not sail for a day or two, and that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know."</conversation> This I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as <conversation speaker="Narrator">"the circumstances"</conversation> were not forthcoming, although I pumped for them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure.
        </p>
        <p n="7">
            <char>Wyatt</char>'s party arrived in about ten minutes after myself. There were the two <char>Mrs. Wyatt</char>, the <char>bride</char>, and the artist—the latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy. I was too well used to these, however, to pay them any special attention. He did not even introduce me to his wife;—this courtesy devolving, per force, upon his sister <char>Marian</char>—a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a few hurried words, made us acquainted.
        </p>
        <p n="8">
            <char>Mrs. Wyatt</char> had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil, in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very profoundly astonished. I should have been much more so, however, had not long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist, when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman. When beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal.
        </p>
        <p n="9">
            The truth is, I could not help regarding <char>Mrs. Wyatt</char> as a decidedly plain-looking woman. If not positively ugly, she was not, I think, very far from it. She was dressed, however, in exquisite taste—and then I had no doubt that she had captivated my friend's heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul. She said very few words, and passed at once into her state-room with <char>Mr. W.</char>
        </p>
        <p n="10">
            My old inquisitiveness now returned. There was NO servant—THAT was a settled point. I looked, therefore, for the extra baggage. After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected. Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea.
        </p>
        <p n="11">
            The box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth; I observed it attentively, and like to be precise. Now this shape was PECULIAR; and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he had been for several weeks in conference with <char>Nicolino</char>:—and now here was a box, which, from its shape, COULD possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo's <conversation speaker="Leonardo">"Last Supper;"</conversation> and a copy of this very <conversation speaker="Rubini">"Last Supper,"</conversation> done by <char>Rubini</char> the younger, at Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in the possession of <char>Nicolino</char>. This point, therefore, I considered as sufficiently settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought of my acumen. It was the first time I had ever known <char>Wyatt</char> to keep from me any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to New York, under my very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter. I resolved to quiz him WELL, now and hereafter.
        </p>
        <p n="12">
            One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. The box did NOT go into the extra stateroom. It was deposited in <char>Wyatt</char>'s own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor—no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife;—this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. On the lid were painted the words—"<char>Mrs. Adelaide Curtis</char>, Albany, New York. Charge of <char>Cornelius Wyatt</char>, Esq. This side up. To be handled with care."
        </p>
        <p n="13">
            Now, I was aware that <char>Mrs. Adelaide Curtis</char>, of Albany, was the artist's wife's mother,—but then I looked upon the whole address as a mystification, intended especially for myself. I made up my mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in Chambers Street, New York.
        </p>
        <p n="14">
            For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward, immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. The passengers were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social. I MUST except, however, <char>Wyatt</char> and his sisters, who behaved stiffly, and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the party. <char>Wyatt</char>'s conduct I did not so much regard. He was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit—in fact he was MOROSE—but in him I was prepared for eccentricity. For the sisters, however, I could make no excuse. They secluded themselves in their staterooms during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused, although I repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any person on board.
        </p>
        <p n="15">
            <char>Mrs. Wyatt</char> herself was far more agreeable. That is to say, she was CHATTY; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea. She became EXCESSIVELY intimate with most of the ladies; and, to my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men. She amused us all very much. I say "amused"—and scarcely know how to explain myself. The truth is, I soon found that <char>Mrs. W.</char> was far oftener laughed AT than WITH. The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little while, pronounced her "a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar." The great wonder was, how <char>Wyatt</char> had been entrapped into such a match. Wealth was the general solution—but this I knew to be no solution at all; for <char>Wyatt</char> had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever. <conversation speaker="Wyatt">"He had married,"</conversation> he said, <conversation speaker="Wyatt">"for love, and for love only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love."</conversation> When I thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend, I confess that I felt indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses? What else could I think? HE, so refined, so intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful! To be sure, the lady seemed especially fond of HIM—particularly so in his absence—when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her <conversation speaker="Mrs. Wyatt">"beloved husband, <char>Mr. Wyatt</char>."</conversation> The word <conversation speaker="Mrs. Wyatt">"husband"</conversation> seemed forever—to use one of her own delicate expressions—forever "on the tip of her tongue." In the meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided HER in the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main cabin.
        </p>
        <p n="16">
            My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that the <char>artist</char>, by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart—but could not, for that reason, quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the "Last Supper." For this I resolved to have my revenge.
        </p>
        <p n="17">
            One day <char>Wyatt</char> came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my wont, I sauntered with him backward and forward. His gloom, however (which I considered quite natural under the circumstances), seemed entirely unabated. He said little, and that moodily, and with evident effort. I ventured a jest or two, and he made a sickening attempt at a smile. Poor fellow!—as I thought of HIS WIFE, I wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth. At last I ventured a home thrust. I determined to commence a series of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box—just to let him perceive, gradually, that I was NOT altogether the butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. My first observation was by way of opening a masked battery. I said something about the <conversation speaker="Narrator">"peculiar shape of THAT box—,"</conversation> and, as I spoke the words, I smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs.
        </p>
        <p n="18">
            The manner in which <char>Wyatt</char> received this harmless pleasantry convinced me, at once, that he was mad. At first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from their sockets. Then he grew very red—then hideously pale—then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. In conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. When I ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was DEAD.
        </p>
        <p n="19">
            I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to himself. Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time. At length we bled him and put him to bed. The next morning he was quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health. Of his mind I say nothing, of course. I avoided him during the rest of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board.
        </p>
        <p n="20">
            Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of <char>Wyatt</char> which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed. Among other things, this: I had been nervous—drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night—in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to sleep at all. Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. <char>Wyatt</char>'s three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. As we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it. But my berth was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as the sliding door in question (and my own door was ALWAYS open on account of the heat), I could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms of <char>Mr. Wyatt</char>. Well, during two nights (NOT consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw <char>Mrs. W.</char>, about eleven o'clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-room of <char>Mr. W.</char>, and enter the extra room, where she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had separate apartments—no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the extra stateroom.
        </p>    
        <p n="21">
            There was another circumstance, too, which interested me much. During the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after the disappearance of <char>Mrs. Wyatt</char> into the extra stateroom, I was attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband. After listening to them for some time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and mallet—the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.
        </p>
        <p n="22">
            In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid—also, that I could determine when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for example, by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down VERY gently—there being no room for it on the floor. After this there was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible—if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination. I say it seemed to RESEMBLE sobbing or sighing—but, of course, it could not have been either. I rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. <char>Mr. Wyatt</char>, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies—indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm. He had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within. There was nothing in this, however, to make him SOB. I repeat, therefore, that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good <char>Captain Hardy</char>'s green tea. Just before dawn, on each of the two nights of which I speak, I distinctly heard <char>Mr. Wyatt</char> replace the lid upon the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet. Having done this, he issued from his state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call <char>Mrs. W.</char> from hers.
        </p>
        <p n="23">
            We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras, when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest. We were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for some time. Every thing was made snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed.
        </p>
        <p n="24">
            In this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours—the ship proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and shipping no water of any consequence. At the end of this period, however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our after-sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one immediately after the other. By this accident we lost three men overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks. Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm staysail and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before.
        </p>
        <p n="25">
            The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its abating. The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by the board. For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold. To add to our dilemma, we found the pumps choked and nearly useless.
        </p>
        <p n="26">
            All was now confusion and despair—but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that remained. This we at last accomplished—but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak gained on us very fast.
        </p>
        <p n="27">
            At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats. At eight P. M., the clouds broke away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon—a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits.
        </p>
        <p n="28">
            After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the longboat over the side without material accident, and into this we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers. This party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering, finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third day after the wreck.
        </p>
        <p n="29">
            Fourteen passengers, with the <char>captain</char>, remained on board, resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern. We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the water. It contained, when afloat, the <char>captain</char> and his wife, <char>Mr. Wyatt</char> and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and myself, with a negro valet.
        </p>
        <p n="30">
            We had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our backs. No one had thought of even attempting to save any thing more. What must have been the astonishment of all, then, when having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, <char>Mr. Wyatt</char> stood up in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of <char>Captain Hardy</char> that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his oblong box!
        </p>
        <p n="31">
            <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"Sit down, <char>Mr. Wyatt</char>,"</conversation> replied <char>the captain</char>, somewhat sternly, <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still. Our gunwhale is almost in the water now."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="32">
            <conversation speaker="Mrs. Wyatt">"The box!"</conversation> vociferated <char>Mr. Wyatt</char>, still standing—<conversation speaker="Mrs. Wyatt">"the box, I say! <char>Captain Hardy</char>, you cannot, you will not refuse me. Its weight will be but a trifle—it is nothing—mere nothing. By the mother who bore you—for the love of Heaven—by your hope of salvation, I implore you to put back for the box!"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="33">
            <char>The captain</char>, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest appeal of the artist, but he regained his stern composure, and merely said:
        </p>
        <p n="34">
            <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"<char>Mr. Wyatt</char>, you are mad. I cannot listen to you. Sit down, I say, or you will swamp the boat. Stay—hold him—seize him!—he is about to spring overboard! There—I knew it—he is over!"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="35">
            As <char>the captain</char> said this, <char>Mr. Wyatt</char>, in fact, sprang from the boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung from the fore-chains. In another moment he was on board, and rushing frantically down into the cabin.
        </p>
        <p n="36">
            In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still running. We made a determined effort to put back, but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest. We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed.
        </p>
        <p n="37">
            As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the companion-way, up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box. While we gazed in the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his body. In another instant both body and box were in the sea—disappearing suddenly, at once and forever.
        </p>
        <p n="38">
            We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted upon the spot. At length we pulled away. The silence remained unbroken for an hour. Finally, I hazarded a remark.
        </p>
        <p n="39">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Did you observe, <char>captain</char>, how suddenly they sank? Was not that an exceedingly singular thing? I confess that I entertained some feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him lash himself to the box, and commit himself to the sea."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="40">
            <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"They sank as a matter of course,"</conversation> replied <char>the captain</char>, <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"and that like a shot. They will soon rise again, however—BUT NOT TILL THE SALT MELTS."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="41">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"The salt!"</conversation> I ejaculated.
        </p>
        <p n="42">
            <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"Hush!"</conversation> said <char>the captain</char>, pointing to the wife and sisters of the deceased. <conversation speaker="Captain Hardy">"We must talk of these things at some more appropriate time."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="43">
            We suffered much, and made a narrow escape, but fortune befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat. We landed, in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense distress, upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island. We remained here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length obtained a passage to New York.
        </p>
        <p n="44">
            About a month after the loss of the <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Independence,"</conversation> I happened to meet <char>Captain Hardy</char> in Broadway. Our conversation turned, naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of poor <char>Wyatt</char>. I thus learned the following particulars.
        </p>
        <p n="45">
            The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and a servant. His wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a most lovely, and most accomplished woman. On the morning of the fourteenth of June (the day in which I first visited the ship), the lady suddenly sickened and died. The young husband was frantic with grief—but circumstances imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to New York. It was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was well known. Nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with a dead body.
        </p>
        <p n="46">
            In this dilemma, <char>Captain Hardy</char> arranged that the corpse, being first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on board as merchandise. Nothing was to be said of the lady's decease; and, as it was well understood that <char>Mr. Wyatt</char> had engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some person should personate her during the voyage. This the deceased lady's-maid was easily prevailed on to do. The extra state-room, originally engaged for this girl during her mistress' life, was now merely retained. In this state-room the pseudo-wife slept, of course, every night. In the daytime she performed, to the best of her ability, the part of her mistress—whose person, it had been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers on board.
        </p>
        <p n="47">
            My own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. But of late, it is a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night. There is a countenance which haunts me, turn as I will. There is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears.

        <p n="2">
            At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend <char>C. Auguste Dupin</char>, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisieme, No. 33, Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of <char>Marie Roget</char>. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, <char>Monsieur G--</char>, the Prefect of the Parisian police.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and <char>Dupin</char> now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon <char>G.</char>’s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"If it is any point requiring reflection,"</conversation> observed <char>Dupin</char>, as he forbore to enkindle the wick, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"That is another of your odd notions,"</conversation> said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling every thing "odd" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of "oddities."
        </p>
        <p n="6">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Very true,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.
        </p>
        <p n="7">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"And what is the difficulty now?"</conversation> I asked. <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Nothing more in the assassination way, I hope?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="8">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought <char>Dupin</char> would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="9">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Simple and odd,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="10">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="11">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,"</conversation> said my friend.
        </p>
        <p n="12">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"What nonsense you do talk!"</conversation> replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.
        </p>
        <p n="13">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="14">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="15">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"A little too self-evident."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="16">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Ha! ha! ha! --ha! ha! ha! --ho! ho! ho!"</conversation> --roared our visitor, profoundly amused, <conversation speaker="Prefect">"oh, <char>Dupin</char>, you will be the death of me yet!"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="17">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"And what, after all, is the matter on hand?"</conversation> I asked.
        </p>
        <p n="18">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Why, I will tell you,"</conversation> replied <char>Prefect</char>, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. <conversation speaker="Prefect">"I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="19">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Proceed,"</conversation> said I.
        </p>
        <p n="20">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Or not,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="21">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="22">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"How is this known?"</conversation> asked <char>Dupin</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="23">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"It is clearly inferred,"</conversation> replied <char>Prefect</char>, <conversation speaker="Prefect">"from the nature of the document, and from the nonappearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; --that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="24">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Be a little more explicit,"</conversation> I said.
        </p>
        <p n="25">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable."</conversation> <char>Prefect</char> was fond of the cant of diplomacy.
        </p>
        <p n="26">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Still I do not quite understand,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="27">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="28">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But this ascendancy,"</conversation> I interposed, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare--"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="29">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"The thief,"</conversation> said <char>Prefect</char>, <conversation speaker="Prefect">"is the Minister <char>D--</char>, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question --a letter, to be frank --had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister <char>D--</char>. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter --one of no importance --upon the table."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="30">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Here, then,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char> to me, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete --the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="31">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Yes,"</conversation> replied <char>Prefect</char>; <conversation speaker="Prefect">"and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="32">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Than whom,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="33">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"You flatter me,"</conversation> replied <char>Prefect</char>; <conversation speaker="Prefect">"but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="34">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"It is clear,"</conversation> said I, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"as you observe, that the letter is still in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the power departs."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="35">
            <conversation speaker="G">"True,"</conversation> said <char>G.</char> <conversation speaker="G">"and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="36">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But,"</conversation> said I, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"you are quite au fait in these investigations. The Parisian police have done this thing often before."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="37">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Oh yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the <char>D-- Hotel</char>. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="38">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But is it not possible,"</conversation> I suggested, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"that although the letter may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="39">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"This is barely possible,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which <char>D--</char> is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document --its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice --a point of nearly equal importance with its possession."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="40">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Its susceptibility of being produced?"</conversation> said I.
        </p>
        <p n="41">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"That is to say, of being destroyed,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="42">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"True,"</conversation> I observed; <conversation speaker="Narrator">"the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the question."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="43">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"Entirely,"</conversation> said <char>Prefect</char>. <conversation speaker="Prefect">"He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="44">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"You might have spared yourself this trouble,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="Dupin">"<char>D--</char>, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="45">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Not altogether a fool,"</conversation> said <char>G.</char>, <conversation speaker="G">"but then he's a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="46">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"True,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="47">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Suppose you detail,"</conversation> said I, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"the particulars of your search."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="48">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched everywhere. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk --of space --to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="49">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Why so?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="50">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="51">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?"</conversation> I asked.
        </p>
        <p n="52">
            <conversation speaker="G">"By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="53">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But you could not have removed --you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="54">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Certainly not; but we did better --we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing --any unusual gaping in the joints --would have sufficed to insure detection."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="55">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and carpets."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="56">
            <conversation speaker="G">"That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="57">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"The two houses adjoining!"</conversation> I exclaimed; <conversation speaker="Narrator">"you must have had a great deal of trouble."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="58">
            <conversation speaker="G">"We had; but the reward offered is prodigious."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="59">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You include the grounds about the houses?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="60">
            <conversation speaker="G">"All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="61">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You looked among <char>D--</char>'s papers, of course, and into the books of the library?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="62">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="63">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You explored the floors beneath the carpets?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="64">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="65">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"And the paper on the walls?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="66">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Yes."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="67">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You looked into the cellars?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="68">
            <conversation speaker="G">"We did."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="69">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Then,"</conversation> I said, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="70">
            <conversation speaker="G">"I fear you are right there,"</conversation> said <char>G--</char>. <conversation speaker="G">"And now, <char>Dupin</char>, what would you advise me to do?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="71">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"To make a thorough re-search of the premises."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="72">
            <conversation speaker="G">"That is absolutely needless,"</conversation> replied <char>G--</char>. <conversation speaker="G">"I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="73">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"I have no better advice to give you,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="Dupin">"You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="74">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Oh yes!"</conversation> --And here <char>G--</char>, producing a memorandum-book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.
        </p>
        <p n="75">
            In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,--
        </p>
        <p n="76">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Well, but <char>G--</char>, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="77">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Confound him, say I --yes; I made the reexamination, however, as <char>Dupin</char> suggested --but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="78">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"How much was the reward offered, did you say?"</conversation> asked <char>Dupin</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="79">
            <conversation speaker="G">"Why, a very great deal --a very liberal reward --I don't like to say how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="80">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Why, yes,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his meerschaum, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"I really --think, <char>G--</char>, you have not exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter. You might --do a little more, I think, eh?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="81">
            <conversation speaker="G">"How? --In what way?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="82">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Why --puff, puff --you might --puff, puff --employ counsel in the matter, eh? --puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="83">
            <conversation speaker="G">"No; hang <char>Abernethy</char>!"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="84">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this <char>Abernethy</char> for a medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="85">
            <conversation speaker="Miser">'We will suppose,' said the <char>miser</char>, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?'</conversation>

        <p n="86">
            <conversation speaker="Abernethy">"'Take!' said <char>Abernethy</char>, 'why, take advice, to be sure.'"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="87">
            <conversation speaker="Prefect">"But,"</conversation> said the <char>Prefect</char>, a little discomposed, <conversation speaker="Prefect">"I am perfectly willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="88">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"In that case,"</conversation> replied <char>Dupin</char>, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="89">
            I was astounded. The <char>Prefect</char> appeared absolutely thunderstricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then, apparently in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to <char>Dupin</char>. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the <char>Prefect</char>. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since <char>Dupin</char> had requested him to fill up the check.
        </p>
        <p n="90">
            When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.
        </p>
        <p n="91">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The Parisian police,"</conversation> he said, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"are exceedingly able in their way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when <char>G--</char> detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel <char>D--</char>, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation --so far as his labors extended."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="92">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"So far as his labors extended?"</conversation> said I.
        </p>
        <p n="93">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Yes,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="94">
            I merely laughed --but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.
        </p>
        <p n="95">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The measures, then,"</conversation> he continued, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the <char>Prefect</char>, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are they even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd'; --he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even' guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed "</conversation>lucky,<conversation speaker="Dupin">" --what, in its last analysis, is it?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="96">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"It is merely,"</conversation> I said, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="97">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"It is,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>; <conversation speaker="Dupin">"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to <char>Rochefoucauld</char>, to <char>La Bougive</char>, to <char>Machiavelli</char>, and to <char>Campanella</char>."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="98">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"And the identification,"</conversation> I said, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="99">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"For its practical value it depends upon this,"</conversation> replied <char>Dupin</char>; <conversation speaker="Dupin">"and the <char>Prefect</char> and his cohort fall so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much --that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency --by some extraordinary reward --they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of <char>D--</char>, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches --what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the <char>Prefect</char>, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter, --not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg --but, at least, in some hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherches nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed --a disposal of it in this recherche manner, --is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance --or, what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude, --the qualities in question have never been known to fall. You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the <char>Prefect</char>'s examination --in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the <char>Prefect</char> --its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the <char>Prefect</char> feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="100">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But is this really the poet?"</conversation> I asked. <conversation speaker="Narrator">"There are two brothers, I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="101">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the <char>Prefect</char>."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="102">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You surprise me,"</conversation> I said, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"by these opinions, which have been contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="103">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"'Il y a a parier,'"</conversation> replied <char>Dupin</char>, quoting from Chamfort, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"'que toute idee publique, toute convention recue, est une sottise, car elle a convenu au plus grand nombre.' The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance --if words derive any value from applicability --then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,' 'religio' religion or 'homines honesti,' a set of honorable men."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="104">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"You have a quarrel on hand, I see,"</conversation> said I, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="105">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of relation --of form and quantity --is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability --as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.' With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="106">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">I mean to say,"</conversation> continued <char>Dupin</char>, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"while I merely laughed at his last observations, that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the <char>Prefect</char> would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fall to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate --and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate --the waylayings to which he was subjected. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the <char>Prefect</char> as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which <char>G--</char>, in fact, did finally arrive --the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed --I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the <char>Prefect</char>. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the <char>Prefect</char> laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="107">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"Yes,"</conversation> said I, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="108">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">The material world,"</conversation> continued <char>Dupin</char>, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the vis inertiae, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of attention?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="109">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"I have never given the matter a thought,"</conversation> I said.
        </p>
        <p n="110">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"There is a game of puzzles,"</conversation> he resumed, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word --the name of town, river, state or empire --any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the <char>Prefect</char>. He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="111">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of <char>D--</char>; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the <char>Prefect</char>, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search --the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="112">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel. I found <char>D--</char> at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive --but that is only when nobody sees him."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="113">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="114">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"I paid special attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="115">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the middle --as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large black seal, bearing the <char>D--</char> cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to <char>D--</char>, the minister, himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the upper divisions of the rack."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="116">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the <char>Prefect</char> had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the <char>D--</char> cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the <char>S--</char> family. Here, the address, to the Minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of <char>D--</char>, and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document; these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="117">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the <char>Minister</char>, on a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the <char>Minister</char> good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="118">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a mob. <char>D--</char> rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings; imitating the <char>D--</char> cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="119">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, <char>D--</char> came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="120">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"But what purpose had you,"</conversation> I asked, <conversation speaker="Narrator">"in replacing the letter by a fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and departed?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="121">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"<char>D--</char>,"</conversation> replied <char>Dupin</char>, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the <char>Minister</char> has had her in his power. She has now him in hers; since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy --at least no pity --for him who descends. He is the monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the <char>Prefect</char> terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="122">
            <conversation speaker="Narrator">"How? did you put any thing particular in it?"</conversation>

        <p n="123">
            <conversation speaker="Dupin">"Why --it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank --that would have been insulting. <char>D--</char>, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words--"</conversation>

            MANY years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of <quote>"love at first sight;"</quote> but those who think, not less than those who feel deeply, have always advocated its existence. Modern discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy -- in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance. The confession I am about to make will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position.

            My story requires that I should be somewhat minute. I am still a very young man -- not yet twenty-two years of age. My name, at present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one -- <char>Simpson</char>. I say <quote>"at present;"</quote> for it is only lately that I have been so called -- having legislatively adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative, <char>Adolphus Simpson, Esq.</char> The bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator, -- the family, not the Christian name; my Christian name is <char>Napoleon Bonaparte</char> -- or, more properly, these are my first and middle appellations.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            I assumed the name, <char>Simpson</char>, with some reluctance, as in my true patronym, <char>Froissart</char>, I felt a very pardonable pride -- believing that I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the Chronicles. While on the subject of names, by the bye, I may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors. My father was a <char>Monsieur Froissart</char>, of Paris. His wife -- my mother, whom he married at fifteen -- was a <char>Mademoiselle Croissart</char>, eldest daughter of <char>Croissart</char> the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when married, was the eldest daughter of one <char>Victor Voissart</char>. <char>Monsieur Voissart</char>, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name -- a <char>Mademoiselle Moissart</char>. She, too, was quite a child when married; and her mother, also, <char>Madame Moissart</char>, was only fourteen when led to the altar. These early marriages are usual in France. Here, however, are <char>Moissart</char>, <char>Voissart</char>, <char>Croissart</char>, and <char>Froissart</char>, all in the direct line of descent. My own name, though, as I say, became <char>Simpson</char>, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.

            As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient. On the contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome face. In height I am five feet eleven. My hair is black and curling. My nose is sufficiently good. My eyes are large and gray; and although, in fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance. The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have resorted to every remedy -- short of wearing glasses. Being youthful and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them. I know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age. An eyeglass, on the other hand, has a savor of downright foppery and affectation. I have hitherto managed as well as I could without either. But something too much of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little importance. I will content myself with saying, in addition, that my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic -- and that all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women.

        <p n="5">
            One night last winter I entered a box at the P- Theatre, in company with a friend, <char>Mr. Talbot</char>. It was an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded. We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.
        </p>
        <p n="6">
            For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the city. Having satisfied myself upon this point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation.
        </p>
        <p n="7">
            If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense emotion with which I regarded this figure. It was that of a female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld. The face was so far turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, I could not obtain a view of it -- but the form was divine; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion -- and even the term <quote>"divine"</quote> seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.
        </p>
        <p n="8">
            The magic of a lovely form in woman -- the necromancy of female gracefulness -- was always a power which I had found it impossible to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions. The figure, almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the majestic. Its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. The head of which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek <char>Psyche</char>, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of <char>Apuleius</char>. The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry. Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion. This extended but little below the elbow. Beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of extraordinary value. The admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels -- telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer.
        </p>
        <p n="9">
            I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning <quote>"love at first sight."</quote> My feelings were totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness. An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the admirable object before me. I saw -- I felt -- I knew that I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in love -- and this even before seeing the face of the person beloved. So intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary character, so anomalous is the nature of the only true love -- of the love at first sight -- and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it.
        </p>
        <p n="10">
            While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the face. Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations -- and yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was. I said <quote>"disappointed,"</quote> but this is not altogether the word. My sentiments were at once quieted and exalted. They partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose. This state of feeling arose, perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this. There was something else -- some mystery which I could not develop -- some expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest. In fact, I was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance. Had the lady been alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two companions -- a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than herself.
        </p>
        <p n="11">
            I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty. I would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had I been so fortunate as to have one with me -- but I had not -- and was thus in despair.
        </p>
        <p n="12">
            At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.
        </p>
        <p n="13">
            <quote>"<char>Talbot</char>,"</quote> I said, <quote>"you have an opera-glass. Let me have it."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="14">
            <quote>"An opera -- glass! -- no! -- what do you suppose I would be doing with an opera-glass?"</quote> Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.
        </p>
        <p n="15">
            <quote>"But, <char>Talbot</char>,"</quote> I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, <quote>"listen to me will you? Do you see the stage -- box? -- there! -- no, the next. -- did you ever behold as lovely a woman?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="16">
            <quote>"She is very beautiful, no doubt,"</quote> he said.
        </p>
        <p n="17">
            <quote>"I wonder who she can be?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="18">
            <quote>"Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don't you know who she is? 'Not to know her argues yourself unknown.' She is the celebrated <char>Madame Lalande</char> -- the beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the whole town. Immensely wealthy too -- a widow, and a great match -- has just arrived from Paris."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="19">
            <quote>"Do you know her?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="20">
            <quote>"Yes; I have the honor."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="21">
            <quote>"Will you introduce me?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="22">
            <quote>"Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="23">
            <quote>"To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at <char>B--'s</char>."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="24">
            <quote>"Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="25">
            In this latter respect I was forced to take <char>Talbot</char>'s advice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage.
        </p>
        <p n="26">
            In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on <char>Madame Lalande</char>, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face. It was exquisitely lovely -- this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had not <char>Talbot</char> fully satisfied me upon the point -- but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperament, with an interest tenfold.
        </p>
        <p n="27">
            While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze. Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant. She turned aside her face, and again I saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head. After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. But what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglass -- elevated it -- adjusted it -- and then regarded me through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes.
        </p>
        <p n="28">
            Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more thoroughly astounded -- astounded only -- not offended or disgusted in the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust. But the whole thing was done with so much quietude -- so much nonchalance -- so much repose -- with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in short -- that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise.
        </p>
        <p n="29">
            I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutes -- for five minutes, at the very least, I am sure.
        </p>
        <p n="30">
            This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of <char>Madame Lalande</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="31">
            Having satisfied her curiosity -- if such it was -- she dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being turned toward myself, as before. I continued to watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing. Presently I saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage, was, in fact, attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my excitable mind.
        </p>
        <p n="32">
            Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had reference to myself.
        </p>
        <p n="33">
            Upon its conclusion, <char>Madame Lalande</char> again turned toward the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance. At the expiration of this period, however, I was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul.
        </p>
        <p n="34">
            This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitement -- into an absolute delirium of love -- served rather to embolden than to disconcert me. In the mad intensity of my devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze. Watching my opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera, I at length caught the eyes of <char>Madame Lalande</char>, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow.
        </p>
        <p n="35">
            She blushed very deeply -- then averted her eyes -- then slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been noticed -- then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side.
        </p>
        <p n="36">
            I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain. I was greatly and immediately relieved, however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishment -- of my profound amazement -- my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul -- when, instantly afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head.
        </p>
        <p n="37">
            It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy -- upon my transport -- upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment. I loved. This was my first love -- so I felt it to be. It was love supreme -- indescribable. It was <quote>"love at first sight;"</quote> and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned.
        </p>
        <p n="38">
            Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an instant. What other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful -- so wealthy -- evidently so accomplished -- of so high breeding -- of so lofty a position in society -- in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured was <char>Madame Lalande</char>? Yes, she loved me -- she returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind -- as uncompromising -- as uncalculating -- as abandoned -- and as utterly unbounded as my own! These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. The audience arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. Quitting <char>Talbot</char> abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with <char>Madame Lalande</char>. Having failed in this, on account of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection that I should be introduced by <char>Talbot</char>, in due form, upon the morrow.
        </p>
        <p n="39">
            This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until <quote>"one"</quote> were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. But even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay. The clock struck. As the last echo ceased, I stepped into B--'s and inquired for <char>Talbot</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="40">
            <quote>"Out,"</quote> said the <char>footman</char> -- <char>Talbot</char>'s own.
        </p>
        <p n="41">
            <quote>"Out!"</quote> I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces -- <quote>"let me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable; Mr. <char>Talbot</char> is not out. What do you mean?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="42">
            <quote>"Nothing, sir; only Mr. <char>Talbot</char> is not in, that's all. He rode over to S--, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he would not be in town again for a week."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="43">
            I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored to reply, but my tongue refused its office. At length I turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the <char>Talbots</char> to the innermost regions of Erebus. It was evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself -- had forgotten it as soon as it was made. At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word. There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries about <char>Madame Lalande</char> to every male acquaintance I met. By report she was known, I found, to all -- to many by sight -- but she had been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance. These few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning call. While I stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of friends upon the all-absorbing subject of my heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by.
        </p>
        <p n="44">
            <quote>"As I live, there she is!"</quote> cried one.
        </p>
        <p n="45">
            <quote>"Surprisingly beautiful!"</quote> exclaimed a second.
        </p>
        <p n="46">
            <quote>"An angel upon earth!"</quote> ejaculated a third.
        </p>
        <p n="47">
            I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box.
        </p>
        <p n="48">
            <quote>"Her companion also wears remarkably well,"</quote> said the one of my trio who had spoken first.
        </p>
        <p n="49">
            <quote>"Astonishingly,"</quote> said the second; <quote>"still quite a brilliant air, but art will do wonders. Upon my word, she looks better than she did at Paris five years ago. A beautiful woman still; -- don't you think so, <char>Froissart</char>? -- <char>Simpson</char>, I mean."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="50">
            <quote>"Still!"</quote> said I, <quote>"and why shouldn't she be? But compared with her friend she is as a rush -- light to the evening star -- a glow -- worm to Antares."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="51">
            <quote>"Ha! ha! ha! -- why, <char>Simpson</char>, you have an astonishing tact at making discoveries -- original ones, I mean."</quote> And here we separated, while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, of which I caught only the lines-
        </p>
        <p n="52">
            Ninon, Ninon, Ninon a bas-
        </p>
        <p n="53">
            A bas Ninon De L'Enclos!
        </p>
        <p n="54">
            During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was consumed. As the carriage of <char>Madame Lalande</char> rolled by our group, I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition.
        </p>
        <p n="55">
            As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as <char>Talbot</char> should think proper to return from the country. In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again. This did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. Every day, in the interim, I had inquired for <char>Talbot</char> at his hotel, and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting <quote>"Not come home yet"</quote> of his footman.
        </p>
        <p n="56">
            Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition little short of madness. <char>Madame Lalande</char>, I had been told, was a Parisian -- had lately arrived from Paris -- might she not suddenly return? -- return before <char>Talbot</char> came back -- and might she not be thus lost to me forever? The thought was too terrible to bear. Since my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly decision. In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured out my whole heart.
        </p>
        <p n="57">
            I spoke boldly, freely -- in a word, I spoke with passion. I concealed nothing -- nothing even of my weakness. I alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meeting -- even to the glances which had passed between us. I went so far as to say that I felt assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct. As a third, I spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a formal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances -- of my affluence -- and with an offer of my heart and of my hand.
        </p>
        <p n="58">
            In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After what seemed the lapse of a century it came.
        </p>
        <p n="59">
            Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear, I really received a letter from <char>Madame Lalande</char> -- the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized <char>Madame Lalande</char>. Her eyes -- her magnificent eyes, had not belied her noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason -- the generous impulses of her nature -- despising the conventional pruderies of the world. She had not scorned my proposals. She had not sheltered herself in silence. She had not returned my letter unopened. She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite fingers. It ran thus:

            This noble -- spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed, no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory. Still <char>Talbot</char> would not return. Alas! could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief? Still, however, he came not. I wrote. He replied. He was detained by urgent business -- but would shortly return. He begged me not to be impatient -- to moderate my transports -- to read soothing books -- to drink nothing stronger than Hock -- and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid. The fool! if he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation? I wrote him again, entreating him to forward one forthwith. My letter was returned by that footman, with the following endorsement in pencil. The scoundrel had joined his master in the country:

            After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal deities both <char>Talbot</char> and <char>Stubbs</char>: -- but there was little use in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint.
        </p>
        <p n="68">
            But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity. Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it avail me to the end. Besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by <char>Madame Lalande</char>? Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows. Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.
        </p>
        <p n="69">
            The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a presence of mind truly Parisian, <char>Madame Lalande</char> took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. The valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.
        </p>
        <p n="70">
            As <char>Madame Lalande</char> spoke English even less fluently than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in French. In this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage.
        </p>
        <p n="71">
            At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of decorum- that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by. I had most imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her acquaintance- thus that I did not possess it -- thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other. And then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date. To wed immediately would be improper -- would be indecorous -- would be outre. All this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me. She went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness -- of imprudence. She bade me remember that I really even know not who she was -- what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society. She begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation -- a will o' the wisp -- a fancy or fantasy of the moment -- a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart. These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us -- and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.
        </p>
        <p n="72">
            I replied as best I could -- as only a true lover can. I spoke at length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion -- of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. In conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course of love -- that course of true love that never did run smooth -- and thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long.
        </p>
        <p n="73">
            This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination. She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered. This was a delicate point -- for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made. She alluded to the topic of age. Was I aware -- was I fully aware of the discrepancy between us? That the age of the husband, should surpass by a few years -- even by fifteen or twenty -- the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband. A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently, alas! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my <char>Eugenie</char> extended very considerably beyond that sum.
        </p>
        <p n="74">
            About all this there was a nobility of soul -- a dignity of candor- which delighted -- which enchanted me -- which eternally riveted my chains. I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me.

            <quote>"My sweetest <char>Eugenie</char>,"</quote> I cried, <quote>"what is all this about which you are discoursing? Your years surpass in some measure my own. But what then?

Now you yourself, my dearest <char>Eugenie</char>, can have numbered no more than -- can have numbered no more than -- no more than -- than -- than -- than-"</quote>

        <p n="76">
            Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that <char>Madame Lalande</char> would interrupt me by supplying her true age. But a Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own. In the present instance, <char>Eugenie</char>, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up and presented to her.
        </p>
        <p n="77">
            <quote>"Keep it!"</quote> she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. <quote>"Keep it for my sake -- for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents. Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire. It is now, to be sure, growing rather dark -- but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning. In the meantime, you shall be my escort home to-night. My friends are about holding a little musical levee. I can promise you, too, some good singing. We French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old acquaintance."</quote>

            With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home. The mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. Of this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. In about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable shadow. This is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt.
        </p>
        <p n="79">
            The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life. <char>Madame Lalande</char> had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard excelled in any private circle out of Vienna. The instrumental performers were many and of superior talents. The vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well. At length, upon a peremptory call for <quote>"<char>Madame Lalande</char>,"</quote> she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room. I would have escorted her myself, but felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I had better remain unobserved where I was. I was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing.
        </p>
        <p n="80">
            The impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more. I know not how adequately to describe it. It arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer. It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her utterance of the romance in Otello -- the tone with which she gave the words <quote>"Sul mio sasso,"</quote> in the Capuletti -- is ringing in my memory yet. Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal composition-ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri. In the final of the Somnambula, she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words:
        </p>
        <p n="81">
            Ah! non guinge uman pensiero
        </p>
        <p n="82">
            Al contento ond 'io son piena.
        </p>
        <p n="83">
            Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave, springing over an interval of two octaves.
        </p>
        <p n="84">
            Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance. Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability.
        </p>
        <p n="85">
            Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally unreserved. She made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative. I concealed nothing -- felt that I had a right to conceal nothing -- from her confiding affection. Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love. I touched upon my college indiscretions -- upon my extravagances -- upon my carousals -- upon my debts -- upon my flirtations. I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled -- of a chronic rheumatism -- of a twinge of hereditary gout -- and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes.
        </p>
        <p n="86">
            <quote>"Upon this latter point,"</quote> said <char>Madame Lalande</char>, laughingly, <quote>"you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime. By the by,"</quote> she continued, <quote>"have you any recollection --"</quote> and here I fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek -- <quote>"have you any recollection, mon cher ami, of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="87">
            As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera.
        </p>
        <p n="88">
            <quote>"Full well -- alas! do I remember it,"</quote> I exclaimed, pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection. They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high value.
        </p>
        <p n="89">
            <quote>"Eh bien! mon ami,"</quote> she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised me -- <quote>"Eh bien! mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. You have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow. Should I yield to your entreaties -- and, I may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom -- would I not be entitled to demand of you a very -- a very little boon in return?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="90">
            <quote>"Name it!"</quote> I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet. <quote>"Name it, my beloved, my <char>Eugenie</char>, my own! -- name it! -- but, alas! it is already yielded ere named."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="91">
            <quote>"You shall conquer, then, mon ami,"</quote> said she, <quote>"for the sake of the <char>Eugenie</char> whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last confessed -- this weakness more moral than physical -- and which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature -- so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character -- and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape. You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief. You will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear spectacles; -- ah, hush! -- you have already consented to wear them, for my sake. You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by a trifling modification thus -- or thus -- it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass. It is in the former mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my sake."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="92">
            This request -- must I confess it? -- confused me in no little degree. But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of the question.
        </p>
        <p n="93">
            <quote>"It is done!"</quote> I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could muster at the moment. <quote>"It is done -- it is most cheerfully agreed. I sacrifice every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, I will place it upon my -- upon my nose, -- and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="94">
            Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow. <char>Talbot</char>, I learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town. I was to see him at once, and procure a carriage. The soiree would scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, <char>Madame Lalande</char> could easily enter it unobserved. We were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married, drop <char>Talbot</char>, and proceed on a short tour to the East, leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best.
        </p>
        <p n="95">
            Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in search of <char>Talbot</char>, but, on the way, I could not refrain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses. The countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one! Those large luminous eyes! -- that proud Grecian nose! -- those dark luxuriant curls! -- <quote>"Ah!"</quote> said I, exultingly to myself, <quote>"this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved!"</quote> I turned the reverse, and discovered the words -- <quote>"Eugenie Lalande -- aged twenty-seven years and seven months."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="96">
            I found <char>Talbot</char> at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power. In a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage with <char>Madame Lalande</char> -- with <char>Mrs. Simpson</char>, I should say -- and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction Northeast by North, half-North.
        </p>
        <p n="97">
            It had been determined for us by <char>Talbot</char>, that, as we were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at C--, a village about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route. At four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn. I handed my adored wife out, and ordered breakfast forthwith. In the meantime we were shown into a small parlor, and sat down.
        </p>
        <p n="98">
            It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of <char>Madame Lalande</char>, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all.
        </p>
        <p n="99">
            <quote>"And now, mon ami,"</quote> said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this train of reflection, <quote>"and now, mon cher ami, since we are indissolubly one -- since I have yielded to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our agreement -- I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestow -- a little promise which it is your intention to keep. Ah! let me see! Let me remember! Yes; full easily do I call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to <char>Eugenie</char> last night. Listen! You spoke thus: 'It is done! -- it is most cheerfully agreed! I sacrifice every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it upon my -- upon my nose, -- and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.' These were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?"</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="100">
            <quote>"They were,"</quote> I said; <quote>"you have an excellent memory; and assuredly, my beautiful <char>Eugenie</char>, there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply. See! Behold! they are becoming -- rather -- are they not?"</quote> And here, having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I applied them gingerly in their proper position; while <char>Madame Simpson</char>, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position.
        </p>
        <p n="101">
            <quote>"Goodness gracious me!"</quote> I exclaimed, almost at the very instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose -- <quote>"My goodness gracious me! -- why, what can be the matter with these glasses?"</quote> and taking them quickly off, I wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again.
        </p>
        <p n="102">
            But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound -- was extreme -- indeed I may say it was horrific. What, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean? Could I believe my eyes? -- could I? -- that was the question. Was that -- was that -- was that rouge? And were those- and were those -- were those wrinkles, upon the visage of <char>Eugenie Lalande</char>? And oh! Jupiter, and every one of the gods and goddesses, little and big! what -- what -- what -- what had become of her teeth? I dashed the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the floor, confronting <char>Mrs. Simpson</char>, with my arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless with terror and with rage.
        </p>
        <p n="103">
            Now I have already said that <char>Madame Eugenie Lalande</char> -- that is to say, <char>Simpson</char> -- spoke the English language but very little better than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions. But rage will carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present case it carried <char>Mrs. Simpson</char> to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand.

            Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of working up <char>Mrs. Simpson</char> into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she lumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she lumped. Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trampled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage.
        </p>
        <p n="118">
            Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated. <quote>"<char>Moissart</char> and <char>Voissart</char>!"</quote> I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one of her pigeon-wings, and <quote>"<char>Croissart</char> and <char>Froissart</char>!"</quote> as she completed another -- <quote>"<char>Moissart</char> and <char>Voissart</char> and <char>Croissart</char> and <char>Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart</char>! -- why, you ineffable old serpent, that's me -- that's me -- d'ye hear? that's me"</quote> -- here I screamed at the top of my voice -- <quote>"that's me-e-e!

            <char>Madame Eugenie Lalande</char>, quasi <char>Simpson</char> -- formerly <char>Moissart</char> -- was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother. In her youth she had been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the Grecian nose of her girlhood. By the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passees of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed, she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated <char>Ninon De L'Enclos</char>.

        <p n="120">
            She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the United States, in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husband's -- a <char>Madame Stephanie Lalande</char>.
        </p>
        <p n="121">
            At the opera, my great, great, grandmother's attention was arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself. Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party respecting me. The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and told her who I was. The information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed. She returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd accident, I had discovered her identity. When, deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so enthusiastically of <char>Talbot</char> who she was, he concluded that I meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was <quote>"the celebrated widow, <char>Madame Lalande</char>."</quote>
        </p>
        <p n="122">
            In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered <char>Talbot</char>, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very naturally turned upon myself. My deficiencies of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown. By way of punishing me for this imprudence, she concocted with <char>Talbot</char> a plot. He purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. My street inquiries about <quote>"the lovely widow, <char>Madame Lalande</char>,"</quote> were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly after leaving <char>Talbot</char>'s hotel will be easily explained, as also their allusion to <char>Ninon De L'Enclos</char>. I had no opportunity of seeing <char>Madame Lalande</char> closely during daylight; and, at her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age. When <quote>"<char>Madame Lalande</char>"</quote> was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary. The songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by <char>Madame Stephanie Lalande</char>. The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoax -- a sting to the epigram of the deception. Its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which I was so especially edified. It is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years. They suited me, in fact, to a T.
        </p>
        <p n="123">
            The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon companion of <char>Talbot</char>'s, and no priest. He was an excellent <quote>"whip,"</quote> however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the <quote>"happy couple"</quote> out of town. <char>Talbot</char> took a seat at his side. The two scoundrels were thus <quote>"in at the death,"</quote> and through a half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama. I believe I shall be forced to call them both out.
        </p>
        <p n="124">
            Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great, grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief, -- but I am the husband of <char>Madame Lalande</char> -- of <char>Madame Stephanie Lalande</char> -- with whom my good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies -- if she ever does -- has been at the trouble of concocting me a match. In conclusion: I am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met without SPECTACLES.

            <title>The Tell-Tale Heart</title>
            <author>by Edgar Allan Poe</author>
            <year>1843</year>

        <p n="1">
            TRUE! -- nervous -- very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses -- not destroyed -- not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily -- how calmly I can tell you the whole story.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture -- a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees -- very gradually -- I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded -- with what caution -- with what foresight -- with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it -- oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly -- very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! -- would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously -- oh, so cautiously -- cautiously (for the hinges creaked) -- I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights -- every night just at midnight -- but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers -- of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back -- but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out -- <conversation speaker="old_man">>"Who's there?"</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="6">
            I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; -- just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
        </p>
        <p n="7">
            Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief -- oh, no! -- it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself -- <conversation speaker="old_man">"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney -- it is only a mouse crossing the floor,"</conversation> or <conversation speaker="old_man">"It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp."</conversation> Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel -- although he neither saw nor heard -- to feel the presence of my head within the room.
        </p>
        <p n="8">
            When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little -- a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it -- you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily -- until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
        </p>
        <p n="9">
            It was open -- wide, wide open -- and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness -- all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
        </p>
        <p n="10">
            And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the senses? -- now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
        </p>
        <p n="11">
            But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! -- do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me -- the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once -- once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.
        </p>
        <p n="12">
            If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.
        </p>
        <p n="13">
            I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye -- not even his -- could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out -- no stain of any kind -- no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all -- ha! ha!
        </p>
        <p n="14">
            When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock -- still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, -- for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.
        </p>
        <p n="15">
            I smiled, -- for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search -- search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.
        </p>
        <p n="16">
            The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: -- it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness -- until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.
        </p>
        <p n="17">
            No doubt I now grew very pale; -- but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased -- and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound -- much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath -- and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly -- more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men -- but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! -- what could I do? I foamed -- I raved -- I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder -- louder -- louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! -- no, no! They heard! -- they suspected! -- they knew! -- they were making a mockery of my horror! -- this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! -- and now -- again! -- hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! --
        </p>
        <p n="18">
            <char>Villains!</char> I shrieked, dissemble no more! I admit the deed! -- tear up the planks! -- here, here! -- it is the beating of his hideous heart!

        <p n="1">
            FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I not -- and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere household events. In their consequences, these events have terrified -- have tortured -- have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to expound them. To me, they have presented little but Horror -- to many they will seem less terrible than barroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place -- some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this point -- and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            <char>Pluto</char> -- this was the cat's name -- was my favorite pet and playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets.
        </p>
        <p n="6">
            Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which my general temperament and character -- through the instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance -- had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For <char>Pluto</char>, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they came in my way. But my disease grew upon me -- for what disease is like Alcohol ! -- and at length even <char>Pluto</char>, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish -- even <char>Pluto</char> began to experience the effects of my ill temper.
        </p>
        <p n="7">
            One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity.
        </p>
        <p n="8">
            When reason returned with the morning -- when I had slept off the fumes of the night's debauch -- I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.
        </p>
        <p n="9">
            In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart -- one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself -- to offer violence to its own nature -- to do wrong for the wrong's sake only -- that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree; -- hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart; -- hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had given me no reason of offence; -- hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin -- a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it -- if such a thing were possible -- even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.

            On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames. The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.
        </p>
        <p n="11">
            I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain of facts -- and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with one exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the fire -- a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words <conversation speaker="narrator">"strange!"</conversation> <conversation speaker="narrator">"singular!"</conversation> and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal's neck.
        </p>
        <p n="12">
            When I first beheld this apparition -- for I could scarcely regard it as less -- my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd -- by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had then accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.
        </p>
        <p n="13">
            Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place.
        </p>
        <p n="14">
            One night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy, my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the object thereupon. I approached it, and touched it with my hand. It was a black cat -- a very large one -- fully as large as <char>Pluto</char>, and closely resembling him in every respect but one. <char>Pluto</char> had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast.
        </p>
        <p n="15">
            Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to it -- knew nothing of it -- had never seen it before.
        </p>
        <p n="16">
            I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great favorite with my wife.
        </p>
        <p n="17">
            For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but -- I know not how or why it was -- its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually -- very gradually -- I came to look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.
        </p>
        <p n="18">
            What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like <char>Pluto</char>, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.
        </p>
        <p n="19">
            With my aversion to this creature, however, its partiality for myself seemed to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly -- let me confess it at once -- by absolute dread of the beast.
        </p>
        <p n="20">
            This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil -- and yet I should be at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own -- yes, even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to own -- that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimæras it would be possible to conceive. My wife had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees -- degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject as fanciful -- it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to name -- and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared -- it was now, I say, the image of a hideous -- of a ghastly thing -- of the GALLOWS ! -- oh, mournful and terrible engine of Horror and of Crime -- of Agony and of Death !
        </p>
        <p n="21">
            And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity. And a brute beast -- whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed -- a brute beast to work out for me -- for me a man, fashioned in the image of the High God -- so much of insufferable wo! Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more! During the former the creature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly, from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face, and its vast weight -- an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no power to shake off -- incumbent eternally upon my heart !
        </p>
        <p n="22">
            Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole intimates -- the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas! was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.
        </p>
        <p n="23">
            One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The creature followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.
        </p>
        <p n="24">
            This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered my mind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments, and destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about casting it in the well in the yard -- about packing it in a box, as if merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in the cellar -- as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims.
        </p>
        <p n="25">
            For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from hardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to resemble the rest of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious.
        </p>
        <p n="26">
            And in this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the new brick-work. When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around triumphantly, and said to myself -- <conversation speaker="narrator">"Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain."</conversation>
        </p>
        <p n="27">
            My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearance during the night -- and thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul!
        </p>
        <p n="28">
            The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not. Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled the premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search had been instituted -- but of course nothing was to be discovered. I looked upon my future felicity as secured.
        </p>
        <p n="29">
            Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers bade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner unexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.
        </p>
        <p n="30">
            <conversation speaker="narrator">"Gentlemen,"</conversation> I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, <conversation speaker="narrator">"I delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health, and a little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this -- this is a very well constructed house."</conversation> (In the rabid desire to say something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.) -- <conversation speaker="narrator">"I may say an excellently well constructed house. These walls -- are you going, gentlemen? -- these walls are solidly put together;"</conversation> and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom.
        </p>
        <p n="31">
            But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb! -- by a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman -- a howl -- a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the dammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.
        </p>
        <p n="32">
            Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to the opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the monster up within the tomb!

        <p n="1">THE mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth,<fos type="metaphor"> the whole air of intuition.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="2">The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the <fos type="simile">unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess.</fos> In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract --Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherche movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst <fos type="hyperbole">throws himself into the spirit of his opponent</fos>, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.</p>
        
        <p n="3">Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by <quote>"the book,"</quote> are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit. He recognises what is played through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation --all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards <fos type="simile">with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="4">The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.</p>
        
        <p n="5">The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.</p>
        
        <p n="6">Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18--, I there became acquainted with a Monsieur <char>C. Auguste Dupin</char>. This young gentleman was of an excellent -- indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.</p>
        
        <p n="7">Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other again and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all,<fos type="metaphor"> I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor</fos>, and the vivid freshness of his imagination. Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought,<fos type="metaphor"> I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price</fos>; and this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper<fos type="personification"> a time-eaten and grotesque mansion,</fos> long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.</p>
        
        <p n="8">Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen --although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors. Indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since <char>Dupin</char> had ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves alone.</p>
        
        <p n="9"><fos type="alliteration">It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamored of the Night for her own sake</fos>; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams --reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford.</p>
        
        <p n="10">At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in <char>Dupin</char>. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise --if not exactly in its display --and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself,<fos type="metaphor"> wore windows in their bosoms,</fos> and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double <char>Dupin</char> --the creative and the resolvent.</p>
        
        <p n="11">Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.</p>
        
        <p n="12">We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once <char>Dupin</char> broke forth with these words:</p>
        
        <p n="13"><conversation speaker="Dupin">"He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Théâtre des Variétés."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="14"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"There can be no doubt of that,"</conversation> I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.</p>
        
        <p n="15"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"<char>Dupin</char>,"</conversation> said I, gravely, <conversation speaker="narrorator">this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know I was thinking of ___ ?"</conversation> Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.</p>
        
        <p n="16">___ <conversation speaker="Dupin">"of <char>Chantilly</char>,"</conversation> said he, <conversation speaker="Dupin">"why do you pause? You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="17">This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections. <char>Chantilly</char> was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the rôle of Xerxes, in Crébillon's tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.</p>
        
        <p n="18"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"Tell me, for Heaven's sake,"</conversation> I exclaimed, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"the method --if method there is --by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter."</conversation> In fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.</p>
        
        <p n="19"><conversation speaker="dupin">"It was the fruiterer,"</conversation> replied my friend, <conversation speaker="dupin">"who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="20"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"The fruiterer! --you astonish me --I know no fruiterer whomsoever."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="21"><conversation speaker="dupin">"The man who ran up against you as we entered the street --it may have been fifteen minutes ago."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="22">I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C___  into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with <char>Chantilly</char> I could not possibly understand.</p>
        
        <p n="23">There was not a particle of charlatanerie about <char>Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="dupin">"I will explain,"</conversation> he said, <conversation speaker="dupin">"and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run thus --<char>Chantilly</char>, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="24">There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:</p>
        
        <p n="25">"We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C___. This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity.</p>
        
        <p n="26">"You kept your eyes upon the ground --glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomy,' a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon <char>Chantilly</char>, which appeared in yesterday's 'Musée,' the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line</p>
        
        <p n="27">Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum</p>
        
        <p n="28">I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and <char>Chantilly</char>. That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler's immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of <char>Chantilly</char>. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow --that <char>Chantilly</char> --he would do better at the Théâtre des Variétés."</p>
        
        <p n="29">Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the <quote>"Gazette des Tribunaux,"</quote> when the following paragraphs arrested our attention.</p>
        
        <p n="30">"EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS. --This morning, about three o'clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char>, and her daughter, <char>Mademoiselle Camille L'Espanaye</char>. After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two gendarmes. By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices, in angry contention, were distinguished, and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased, and everything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves, and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment.</p>
        
        <p n="31">"The apartment was in the wildest disorder --the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of métal d'Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.</p>
        
        <p n="32">Of <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,<fos type="metaphor"> as if the deceased had been throttled to death.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="33">After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell off. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated --the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.</p>
        
        <p n="34"><quote>"To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clew."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="35">The next day's paper had these additional particulars.</p>
        
        <p n="36"><quote>"The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue. Many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair." [The word 'affaire' has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys with us,] "but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it. We give below all the material testimony elicited.</quote></p>
        
        <p n="37"><char>Pauline Dubourg</char>, laundress, deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period. The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms --very affectionate towards each other. They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story.</p>
        
        <p n="38"><char>Pierre Moreau</char>, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> for nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided there. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found, for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house was the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years. The two lived an exceedingly retired life --were reputed to have money. Had heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes --did not believe it. Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times.</p>
        
        <p n="39">Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one was spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there were any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The house was a good house --not very old.</p>
        
        <p n="40"><char>Isidore Musèt</char>, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house about three o'clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet --not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom nor top. The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced --and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony --were loud and drawn out, not short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention --the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller --a very strange voice. Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was positive that it was not a woman's voice. Could distinguish the words 'sacré' and 'diable.' The shrill voice was that of a foreigner. Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday.</p>
        
        <p n="41"><char>Henri Duval</char>, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the testimony of Musèt in general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this witness thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not be sure that it was a man's voice. It might have been a woman's. Was not acquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian. Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.</p>
        
        <p n="42">___ <char>Odenheimer</char>, restaurateur. This witness volunteered his testimony. Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of Amsterdam. Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes --probably ten. They were long and loud --very awful and distressing. Was one of those who entered the building. Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a man --of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words uttered. They were loud and quick --unequal --spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh --not so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly 'sacré,' 'diable,' and once 'mon Dieu.'</p>
        
        <p n="43"><char>Jules Mignaud</char>, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine. Is the elder Mignaud. <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> had some property. Had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year ---- (eight years previously). Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk went home with the money.</p>
        
        <p n="44"><char>Adolphe Le Bon</char>, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in question, about noon, he accompanied <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> to her residence with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did not see any person in the street at the time. It is a bye-street --very lonely.</p>
        
        <p n="45"><char>William Bird</char>, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out several words, but cannot now remember all. Heard distinctly 'sacré' and 'mon Dieu.' There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling --a scraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud --louder than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman's voice. Does not understand German.</p>
        
        <p n="46">Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it. Every thing was perfectly silent --no groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door no person was seen. The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked. The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked, with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage, was open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys. The house was a four story one, with garrets (mansardes.) A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely --did not appear to have been opened for years. The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made it as short as three minutes --some as long as five. The door was opened with difficulty.</p>
        
        <p n="47"><char>Alfonzo Garcio</char>, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the house. Did not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said. The shrill voice was that of an Englishman --is sure of this. Does not understand the English language, but judges by the intonation.</p>
        
        <p n="48"><char>Alberto Montani</char>, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared to be expostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates the general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia.</p>
        
        <p n="49">Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being. By 'sweeps' were meant cylindrical sweeping-brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength.</p>
        
        <p n="50"><char>Paul Dumas</char>, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances. The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron --a chair -- any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument --probably with a razor.</p>
        
        <p n="51"><char>Alexandre Etienne</char>, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.</p>
        
        <p n="52">Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris --if indeed a murder has been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault --an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow of a clew apparent.</p>
        
        <p n="53">The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the Quartier St. Roch --that the premises in question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however, mentioned that <char>Adolphe Le Bon</char> had been arrested and imprisoned --although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.</p>
        
        <p n="54"><char>Dupin</char> seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair --at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders.</p>
        
        <p n="55">I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer.</p>
        
        <p n="56"><conversation speaker="dupin">"We must not judge of the means,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, by this shell of an examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain's calling for his robe-de-chambre --pour mieux entendre la musique. The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man. But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. <fos type="metaphor">Truth is not always in a well.</fos> In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial. <fos type="metaphor">The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her,</fos> and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances --to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly -- is to have the best appreciation of its lustre --a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought;<fos type="metaphor"> and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="57"><quote>"As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us amusement," (I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing) "and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes. I know G___, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="58">The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue. This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge. Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building --<char>Dupin</char>, meanwhile, examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.</p>
        
        <p n="59">Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge. We went up stairs --into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the <quote>"Gazette des Tribunaux."</quote> <char>Dupin</char> scrutinized every thing --not excepting the bodies of the victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure. On our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.</p>
        
        <p n="60">I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Je les ménagais: --for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity.</p>
        
        <p n="61">There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word <quote>"peculiar,"</quote> which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.</p>
        
        <p n="62"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"No, nothing peculiar," I said; "nothing more, at least, than we both saw stated in the paper."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="63"><conversation speaker="duplin">"The 'Gazette,' "</conversation> he replied, <conversation speaker="diplin">"has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution --I mean for the outré character of its features. The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive --not for the murder itself --but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before.' In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="64">I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.</p>
        
        <p n="65"><conversation speaker="duplin">"I am now awaiting,"</conversation> continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment --<conversation speaker="duplin">"I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these <fos type="metaphor">butcheries,</fos> must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look for the man here --in this room --every moment. It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will. Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="66">I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while <char>Dupin</char> went on,<fos type="simile"> very much as if in a soliloquy.</fos> I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. His eyes,<fos type="hyperbole"> vacant in expression,</fos> regarded only the wall.</p>
        
        <p n="67"><conversation speaker="dupin">"That the voices heard in contention,"</conversation> he said, <conversation speaker="dupin">"by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention. Let me now advert --not to the whole testimony respecting these voices --but to what was peculiar in that testimony. Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="68">I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.</p>
        
        <p n="69"><conversation speaker="dupin">"That was the evidence itself,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, <conversation speaker="dupin">"but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet there was something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is --not that they disagreed --but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen. Each likens it --not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant --but the converse. The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.' The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that 'not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.' The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and 'does not understand German.' The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was that of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, 'as he has no knowledge of the English.' The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but 'has never conversed with a native of Russia.' A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by the intonation.' Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited! --in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic --of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points. The voice is termed by one witness 'harsh rather than shrill.' It is represented by two others to have been 'quick and unequal.' No words --no sounds resembling words --were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="70"><conversation speaker="dupin">"I know not,"</conversation> continued <char>Dupin</char>, "<conversation speaker="dupin">what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony --the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices --are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said 'legitimate deductions;' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result. What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form --a certain tendency --to my inquiries in the chamber.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="71">"Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we first seek here? <fos type="hyperbole">The means of egress employed by the murderers.</fos> It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural events. Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how? Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision. --Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction. No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance. But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then, no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent 'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such.</p>
        
        <p n="72">"There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within. It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.</p>
        
        <p n="73">"My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given --because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality.</p>
        
        <p n="74">"I proceeded to think thus --à posteriori. The murderers did escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened; --the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes were fastened. They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.</p>
        
        <p n="75">"I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught --but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The assassins must have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor. I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner --driven in nearly up to the head.</p>
        
        <p n="76">You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.' The scent had never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result, --and that result was the nail. It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew. 'There must be something wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.' I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete -- the fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect.</p>
        
        <p n="77">The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail, --farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.</p>
        
        <p n="78">The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades --a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux. They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis <fos type="metaphor">--thus affording an excellent hold for the hands.</fos> In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open --that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected. --By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.</p>
        
        <p n="79">I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished: --but, secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary --the almost preternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it.</p>
        
        <p n="80">You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that 'to make out my case,' I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter. This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object is only the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxta-position, that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken, with that very peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected.</p>
        
        <p n="81">At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of <char>Dupin</char> flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension, without power to comprehend --as men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. My friend went on with his discourse.</p>
        
        <p n="82"><conversation speaker="dupin">"You will see,"</conversation> he said, <conversation speaker="dupin">"that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here. The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is a mere guess --a very silly one --and no more. How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained? <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life --saw no company --seldom went out --had little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best --why did he not take all? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold was abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice. Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities -- that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence. It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, <fos type="metaphor">we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.</fos></conversation></p>
        
        <p n="83">"Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention --that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this --let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit that there was something excessively outré --something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!</p>
        
        <p n="84">Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses --very thick tresses --of grey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp --sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them --because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.</p>
        
        <p n="85"><conversation speaker="dupin">"If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your fancy?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="86">I felt a creeping of the flesh as <char>Dupin</char> asked me the question. <conversation speaker="narrorator">"A madman,"</conversation> I said, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"has done this deed --some raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring Maison de Santé."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="87"><conversation speaker="dupin">"In some respects,"</conversation> he replied, <conversation speaker="dupin">"your idea is not irrelevant. But the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char>. Tell me what you can make of it."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="88"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"<char>Dupin</char>!"</conversation> I said, completely unnerved; <conversation speaker="dupin">"this hair is most unusual --this is no human hair."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="89"><conversation speaker="dupin">"I have not asserted that it is,"</conversation> said he; <conversation speaker="dupin">"but, before we decide this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper. It is a fac-simile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as 'dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails,' upon the throat of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a 'series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.'</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="90"><conversation speaker="dupin">"You will perceive,"</conversation> continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, <conversation speaker="dupin">"that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold. There is no slipping apparent. Each finger has retained --possibly until the death of the victim --the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="91">I made the attempt in vain.</p>
        
        <p n="92"><conversation speaker="dupin">"We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,"</conversation> he said. <conversation speaker="dupin">"The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="93">I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. <conversation speaker="narrorator">"This," I said, "is the mark of no human hand."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="94"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Read now,"</conversation> replied <char>Dupin</char>, <conversation speaker="dupin">"this passage from Cuvier."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="95">It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.</p>
        
        <p n="96"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"The description of the digits,"</conversation> said I, as I made an end of reading, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"is in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="97"><conversation speaker="dupin">"True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice, --the expression, 'mon Dieu!' This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder. It is possible --indeed it is far more than probable --that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it. It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses --for I have no right to call them more --<fos type="personification">since the shades of reflection </fos>upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak of them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement, which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of 'Le Monde,' (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our residence."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="98">He handed me a paper, and I read thus:</p>
        
        <p n="99">CAUGHT -- In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the ___ inst., (the morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species. The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping. Call at No. ___ , Rue ___, Faubourg St. Germain --au troisiême.</p>
        
        <p n="100"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"How was it possible,"</conversation> I asked, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="101"><conversation speaker="dupin">"I do not know it," said <char>Dupin</char>. "I am not sure of it. Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement --about demanding the Ourang-Outang. He will reason thus: --'I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value --to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself --why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne --at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault --they have failed to procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, I am known. The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.' "</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="102">At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.</p>
        
        <p n="103"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Be ready,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, <conversation speaker="dupin">"with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="104">The front door of the house had been left open, and the visiter had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase. Now, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending. <char>Dupin</char> was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up. He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our chamber.</p>
        
        <p n="105"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Come in,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, in a cheerful and hearty tone.</p>
        
        <p n="106">A man entered. He was a sailor, evidently, --a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio. He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed awkwardly, and bade us <quote>"good evening,"</quote> in French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin.</p>
        
        <p n="107"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Sit down, my friend,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>. <conversation speaker="dupin">"I suppose you have called about the Ourang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you suppose him to be?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="108">The <char>sailor</char> drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:</p>
        
        <p n="109"><conversation speaker="sailor">"I have no way of telling --but he can't be more than four or five years old. Have you got him here?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="110"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Oh no; we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of course you are prepared to identify the property?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="111"><conversation speaker="sailor">"To be sure I am, sir."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="112"><conversation speaker="dupin">"I shall be sorry to part with him,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>.</p>
        
        <p n="113"><conversation speaker="sailor">"I don't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,"</conversation> said the man. <conversation speaker="sailor">"Couldn't expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal -- that is to say, any thing in reason."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="114"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Well,"</conversation> replied my friend, <conversation speaker="dupin">"that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me think! --what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be this. You shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="115"><char>Dupin</char> said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table.</p>
        
        <p n="116">The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation. He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel; but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.</p>
        
        <p n="117"><conversation speaker="dupin">"My friend,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, in a kind tone, <conversation speaker="dupin">"you are alarming yourself unnecessarily --you are indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter --means of which you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have done nothing which you could have avoided --nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason for concealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="118">The sailor had recovered his presence of mind,<fos type="metaphor"> in a great measure,</fos> while <char>Dupin</char> uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone.</p>
        
        <p n="119"><conversation speaker="sailor">"So help me God,"</conversation> said he, after a brief pause, <conversation speaker="sailor">"I will tell you all I know about this affair; --but I do not expect you to believe one half I say --I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="120">What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure. Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang- Outang. This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell it.</p>
        
        <p n="121">Returning home from some sailors' frolic the night, or rather in the morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.</p>
        
        <p n="122">The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning. In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char>'s chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.</p>
        
        <p n="123">The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning-rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.</p>
        
        <p n="124">As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master,<fos type="hyperbole"> rigid with horror</fos>, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong.</p>
        
        <p n="125">As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home --dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute.</p>
        
        <p n="126">I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door. It must have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes. Le Bon was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from <char>Dupin</char>) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of every person minding his own business.</p>
        
        <p n="127"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Let him talk,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, who had not thought it necessary to reply. <conversation speaker="dupin">"Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience. I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no stamen. <fos type="simile">It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna </fos>, -- <fos type="simile">or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish.</fos> But he is a good creature after all. I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has 'de nier ce qui est, et d'expliquer ce qui n'est pas.'

        <p n="1">THE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of <fos type="alliteration">commingled gloom and grandeur</fos> which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with <fos type="alliteration">manifold and multiform armorial</fos> trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary -- in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade <char>Pedro</char> to close the heavy shutters of the room -- since it was already night -- to light the <fos type="metaphor">tongues of a tall candelabrum</fos> which stood by the head of my bed -- and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.</p>
        
        <p n="2">Long -- long I read -- and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.</p>
        
        <p n="3">But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought -- to make sure that my vision had not deceived me -- to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.</p>
        
        <p n="4">That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.</p>
        
        <p n="5">The portrait, I have already said, was that of a <char>young girl</char>. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea -- must have prevented even its momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words which follow:</p>
        
        <p n="6">She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the <char>painter</char>. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; <fos type="simile">all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn</fos>; loving and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the <char>painter</char> speak of his desire to pourtray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the <char>painter</char>, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to day. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the <char>painter</char> (who had high renown) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak. <fos type="irony">And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the <char>painter</char> than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the <char>painter</char> had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife.</fos> And he would no see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him. <fos type="simile">And when many weeks bad passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp</fos>. And then the brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the <char>painter</char> stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice, <quote>'This is indeed Life itself!'</quote> turned suddenly to regard his beloved: -- She was dead!</p>

        <p n="2">I WAS sick -- sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving me. The sentence -- the dread sentence of death -- was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution -- perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges. <fos type="alliteration">They appeared to me white -- whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words</fos> -- and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness -- of immoveable resolution -- of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and<fos type="simile"> I felt every fibre in my frame</fos> thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. <fos type="simile">And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave.</fos> The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly;<fos type="alliteration"> the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades</fos>. <fos type="alliteration">Then silence, and stillness, night were the universe.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="3">I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber -- no! In delirium -- no! In a swoon -- no! In death -- no! even in the grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. <fos type="metaphor">Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream.</fos> Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond. And that gulf is -- what? How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower -- is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.</p>
        
        <p n="4">Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down -- down -- still down -- till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness -- the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.</p>
        
        <p n="5">Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound -- the tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and motion, and touch -- a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought -- a condition which lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.</p>
        
        <p n="6">So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence; -- but where and in what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.</p>
        
        <p n="7">A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions. I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.</p>
        
        <p n="8">And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated -- fables I had always deemed them -- but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me? That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.</p>
        
        <p n="9">My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry -- very smooth, slimy, and cold. I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.</p>
        
        <p n="10">Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight more; -- when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for vault I could not help supposing it to be.</p>
        
        <p n="11">I had little object -- certainly no hope these researches; but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs. I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.</p>
        
        <p n="12">In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this -- my chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it fall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.</p>
        
        <p n="13">I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. <fos type="alliteration">And the death just avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition</fos>. To the victims of its tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.</p>
        
        <p n="14">Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon. In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of cowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits -- that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.</p>
        
        <p n="15">Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught. It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. <fos type="simile">A deep sleep fell upon me -- a sleep like that of death.</fos> How long it lasted of course, I know not; but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.</p>
        
        <p n="16">In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the vault. I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps -- thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.</p>
        
        <p n="17">I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure. In feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. <fos type="metaphor">In the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped;</fos> but it was the only one in the dungeon.</p>
        
        <p n="18">All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.</p>
        
        <p n="19">Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.</p>
        
        <p n="20">A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well, which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent of the meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare them away.</p>
        
        <p n="21">It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What I then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended. <fos type="hyperbole">I now observed -- with what horror it is needless to say -- that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor.</fos> Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.</p>
        
        <p n="22">I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents -- the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself -- the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application of such a term.</p>
        
        <p n="23">What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch by inch -- line by line -- with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages -- down and still down it came! Days passed -- it might have been that many days passed -- ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils. I prayed -- I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare bauble.</p>
        
        <p n="24">There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for, upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very -- oh, inexpressibly sick and weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of joy -- of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, a half formed thought -- man has many such which are never completed. I felt that it was of joy -- of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its formation. In vain I struggled to perfect -- to regain it. Long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an imbecile -- an idiot.</p>
        
        <p n="25">The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart. It would fray the serge of my robe -- it would return and repeat its operations -- again -- and again. Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep (some thirty feet or more) and the hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention -- as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment -- upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge.</p>
        
        <p n="26">Down -- steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right -- to the left -- far and wide -- with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant.</p>
        
        <p n="27">Down -- certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches of my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther. Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche!</p>
        
        <p n="28">Down -- still unceasingly -- still inevitably down! I gasped and struggled at each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a relief, oh! how unspeakable! <fos type="alliteration">Still I quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom.</fos> It was hope that prompted the nerve to quiver -- the frame to shrink. It was hope -- the hope that triumphs on the rack -- that whispers to the death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.</p>
        
        <p n="29">I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first time during many hours -- or perhaps days -- I thought. It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility! Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, in last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions -- save in the path of the destroying crescent.</p>
        
        <p n="30">Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my brain when I raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now present -- feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite, -- but still entire. I proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution.</p>
        
        <p n="31">For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold, ravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. <quote>"To what food,"</quote> I thought, <quote>"have they been accustomed in the well?"</quote></p>
        
        <p n="32">They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. <fos type="alliteration">In their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.</fos> With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.</p>
        
        <p n="33">At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change -- at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood -- they overran it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed -- they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than human resolution I lay still.</p>
        
        <p n="34">Nor had I erred in my calculations -- nor had I endured in vain. I at length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body. But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement -- cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow -- I slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was free.</p>
        
        <p n="35">Free! -- and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free! -- I had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual -- some change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly -- it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.</p>
        
        <p n="36">As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard as unreal.</p>
        
        <p n="37">Unreal! -- Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies! A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood. I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors -- oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. <fos type="simile">Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm.</fos> I rushed to its deadly brink. I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length it forced -- it wrestled its way into my soul -- it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. -- Oh! for a voice to speak! -- oh! horror! -- oh! any horror but this! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands -- weeping bitterly.</p>
        
        <p n="38">The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell -- and now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its iron angles were now acute -- two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace. <conversation speaker="narrorator">"Death,"</conversation> I said, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"any death but that of the pit!"</conversation> Fool! might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its pressure And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank back -- but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink -- I averted my eyes --</p>
        
        <p n="39">There was a discordant hum of human voices! <fos type="simile">There was a loud blast as of many trumpets!</fos> There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss. It was that of <char>General Lasalle</char>. The French army had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.</p>

            <author>by Edgar Allan Poe</author>
            <year>(published 1850)</year></info>
        
        <p n="1">THERE are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction. These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or to disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity and majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with the most intense of <quote>"pleasurable pain"</quote> over the accounts of the Passage of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London, of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But in these accounts it is the fact -- it is the reality -- it is the history which excites. As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.</p>
        
        <p n="2">I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities on record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character of the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remind the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries, I might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster. The true wretchedness, indeed -- the ultimate woe -- is particular, not diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit, and never by man the mass -- for this let us thank a merciful God!</p>
        
        <p n="3">To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those who think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. <fos type="alliteration">Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?</fos> We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these cessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels.<fos type="hyperbole"> The silver cord was not for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken.</fos> But where, meantime, was the soul?</p>
        
        <p n="4">Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such causes must produce such effects --that the well-known occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and then, to premature interments --apart from this consideration, we have the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer at once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances. One of very remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense, and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable citizens-a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress --was seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skill of her physicians. After much suffering she died, or was supposed to die. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was not actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition.</p>
        
        <p n="5">The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus; -- but, alas! how fearful a shock awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its portals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling within his arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded shroud.</p>
        
        <p n="6">A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so broken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been exhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin, with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became entangled in some iron -- work which projected interiorly. Thus she remained, and thus she rotted, erect.</p>
        
        <p n="7">In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France, attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was <char>Julien Bossuet</char>, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris. His talents and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her. Having passed with him some wretched years, she died, -- at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her. She was buried -- not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried alive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health. Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady's appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her. They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife. This claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long lapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the authority of the husband.</p>
        
        <p n="8">The <quote>"Chirurgical Journal"</quote> of Leipsic -- a periodical of high authority and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate and republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the character in question.</p>
        
        <p n="9">An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended. Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other of the ordinary means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was thought that he died.</p>
        
        <p n="10">The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, <fos type="metaphor">much thronged with visiters,</fos> and about noon an intense excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of the officer, he had distinctly <fos type="metaphor">felt a commotion of the earth,</fos> as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention was paid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared. He was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.</p>
        
        <p n="11">He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced to be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hours he revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.</p>
        
        <p n="12">From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious of life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted. He heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make himself heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position.</p>
        
        <p n="13">This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the <fos type="metaphor">quackeries of medical experiment</fos>. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.</p>
        
        <p n="14">The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London, who had been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created, at the time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse.</p>
        
        <p n="15">The patient, <char>Mr. Edward Stapleton</char>, had died, apparently of typhus fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit it. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private. Arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of <fos type="metaphor">body-snatchers,</fos> with which London abounds; and, upon the third night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private hospitals.</p>
        
        <p n="16">An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen, when the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree of life-likeness in the convulsive action.</p>
        
        <p n="17">It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient, at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however, was especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash was made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds, and then -- spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words were uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell heavily to the floor.</p>
        
        <p n="18">For some moments all were paralyzed with awe -- but the urgency of the case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr. Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his friends -- from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their wonder -- their rapturous astonishment -- may be conceived.</p>
        
        <p n="19">The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no period was he altogether insensible -- that, dully and confusedly, he was aware of everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to the floor of the hospital. <quote>"I am alive,"</quote> were the uncomprehended words which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.</p>
        
        <p n="20">It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these -- but I forbear -- for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact that premature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from the nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely, in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the most fearful of suspicions.</p>
        
        <p n="21">Fearful indeed the suspicion -- but more fearful the doom! It may be asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is burial before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs -- the stifling fumes from the damp earth -- the clinging to the death garments -- the rigid embrace of the narrow house -- the blackness of the absolute Night -- the silence like a sea that overwhelms -- the unseen but palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm -- these things, with the thoughts of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be informed -- that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead -- these considerations, I say, carry into the heart, which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of nothing so agonizing upon Earth -- we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What I have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge -- of my own positive and personal experience.</p>
        
        <p n="22">For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more definitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks -- even for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death. Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding. In this lies the principal security from inhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.</p>
        
        <p n="23">My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by little, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking, to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe. Total annihilation could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke, however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure. Just as the day dawns to the <fos type="metaphor">friendless and houseless beggar</fos> who roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night -- just so tardily -- just so wearily -- just so cheerily came back the light of the Soul to me.</p>
        
        <p n="24">Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady -- unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity; -- the mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a condition of absolute abeyance.</p>
        
        <p n="25">In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked <quote>"of worms, of tombs, and epitaphs."</quote> I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the former, the torture of meditation was excessive -- in the latter, supreme. When the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of thought, <fos type="simile">I shook -- shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse.</fos> When Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that I consented to sleep -- for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the one sepulchral Idea.</p>
        
        <p n="26">From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams, I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed in a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity. Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering voice whispered the word <quote>"Arise!"</quote> within my ear.</p>
        
        <p n="27">I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of him who had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which I had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. While I remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought, the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly, while the gibbering voice said again:</p>
        
        <p n="28"><quote>Arise! did I not bid thee arise?"</quote></p>
        
        <p n="29"><quote>"And who,"</quote> I demanded, <quote>"art thou?"</quote></p>
        
        <p n="30"><quote>"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,"</quote> replied the voice, mournfully; <quote>"I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but am pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder. -- My teeth chatter as I speak, yet it is not with the chilliness of the night -- of the night without end. But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly sleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights are more than I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle of woe? -- Behold!"</quote></p>
        
        <p n="31">I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist, had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see into the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers were fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed tranquilly to repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been entombed. And the voice again said to me as I gazed:</p>
        
        <p n="32"><quote>"Is it not -- oh! is it not a pitiful sight?"</quote> -- but, before I could find words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: <quote>"Is it not -- O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight?"</quote></p>
        
        <p n="33">Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home. In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason -- would accept no consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas? what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!</p>
        
        <p n="34">There arrived an epoch -- as often before there had arrived -- in which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly -- with a <fos type="metaphor">tortoise gradation </fos>-- approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A torpid uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care -- no hope -- no effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger -- by the one spectral and ever-prevalent idea.</p>
        
        <p n="35">For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without motion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate -- and yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair -- such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being -- despair alone urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes. I uplifted them. It was dark -- all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I had now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties -- and yet it was dark -- all dark -- the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that endureth for evermore.</p>
        
        <p n="36">I endeavored to shriek-, and my lips and my parched tongue moved convulsively together in the attempt -- but no voice issued from the cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and struggling inspiration.</p>
        
        <p n="37">The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I lay upon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were, also, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my limbs -- but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at length, with the wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance, which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face. I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a coffin at last.</p>
        
        <p n="38">And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub Hope -- for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists for the bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared -- and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was not within the vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from home-while among strangers -- when, or how, I could not remember -- and it was they who had buried me as a dog -- nailed up in some common coffin -- and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and nameless grave.</p>
        
        <p n="39">As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in this second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.</p>
        
        <p n="40"><conversation speaker="stranger 1">"Hillo! hillo, there!"</conversation> said a gruff voice, in reply.</p>
        
        <p n="41"><conversation speaker="stranger 2">"What the devil's the matter now!"</conversation> said a second.</p>
        
        <p n="42"><conversation speaker="stranger 3">"Get out o' that!"</conversation> said a third.</p>
        
        <p n="43"><conversation speaker="stranger 4">"What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a cattymount?"</conversation> said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking individuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber -- for I was wide awake when I screamed -- but they restored me to the full possession of my memory.</p>
        
        <p n="44">This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made the best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the only two berths in the vessel -- and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision -- for it was no dream, and no nightmare -- arose naturally from the circumstances of my position -- from my ordinary bias of thought -- and from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary nightcap.</p>
        
        <p n="45">The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully -- they were inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired tone -- acquired temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than Death. I discarded my medical books. <quote>"Buchan"</quote> I burned. I read no <quote>"Night Thoughts"</quote> -- no fustian about churchyards -- no bugaboo tales -- such as this. In short, I became a new man, and lived a man's life. From that memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been less the consequence than the cause.</p>
        
        <p n="46">There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell -- but the imagination of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas! the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether fanciful -- but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us -- they must be suffered to slumber, or we perish.</p>

        <p n="1">THERE are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them. Such sentiments -- for the half-credences of which I speak have never the full force of thought -- such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation.</p>
        
        <p n="2">The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make public, will be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences, whose secondary or concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in the late murder of <char>MARY CECILIA ROGERS</char>, at New York.</p>
        
        <p n="3">When, in an article entitled <quote>"The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"</quote> I endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable features in the mental character of my friend, the <char>Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin</char>, it did not occur to me that I should ever resume the subject. This depicting of character constituted my design; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to instance <char>Dupin</char>'s idiosyncrasy. I might have adduced other examples, but I should have proven no more. Late events, however, in their surprising development, have startled me into some farther details, which will carry with them the air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have lately heard, it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in regard to what I both heard and saw so long ago.</p>
        
        <p n="4">Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the affair at once from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie. Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in with his humor; and, continuing to occupy our chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, <fos type="personification">we gave the Future to the winds</fos>, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present, <fos type="hyperbole">weaving the dull world around us into dreams</fos>.</p>
        
        <p n="5">But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted. It may readily be supposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama at the Rue Morgue, had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the Parisian police. With its emissaries, the name of <char>Dupin</char> had grown into a household word. The simple character of those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the Prefect, or to any other individual than myself, of course it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous, or that the Chevalier's analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition. His frankness would have led him to disabuse every inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased. It thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of the policial eyes; and the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services at the Prefecture. One of the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named <char>Marie Rogêt</char>.</p>
        
        <p n="6">This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue Morgue.<fos type="metaphor"><char> Marie</char>, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate <quote>"cigar-girl,"</quote></fos> was the only daughter of the widow <char>Estelle Rogêt</char>. The father had died during the child's infancy, and from the period of his death, until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée; Madame there keeping a pension, assisted by<char> Marie</char>. Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting that neighborhood. <char>Monsieur Le Blanc</char> was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair<char> Marie</char> in his perfumery; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl, although with somewhat more of hesitation by <char>Madame</char>.</p>
        
        <p n="7">The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly grisette. She had been in his employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown into confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop. <char>Monsieur Le Blanc</char> was unable to account for her absence, and <char>Madame Rogêt</char> was distracted with anxiety and terror. The public papers immediately took up the theme, and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations, when, one fine morning, after the lapse of a week,<char> Marie</char>, in good health, but with a somewhat saddened air, made her re-appearance at her usual counter in the perfumery. All inquiry, except that of a private character, was of course immediately hushed. <char>Monsieur Le Blanc</char> professed total ignorance, as before.<char> Marie</char>, with <char>Madame</char>, replied to all questions, that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the country. Thus the affair died away, and was generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer, and sought the shelter of her mother's residence in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée.</p>
        
        <p n="8">It was about five months after this return home, that her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time. Three days elapsed, and nothing was heard of her. <fos type="imagery">On the fourth her corpse was found floating in the Seine, near the shore which is opposite the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andrée, and at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule</fos>.</p>
        
        <p n="9">The atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evident that murder had been committed,) the youth and beauty of the victim, and, above all, her previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians. I can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect. For several weeks, in the discussion of this one <fos type="metaphor">absorbing theme</fos>, even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten. The Prefect made unusual exertions; and the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to the utmost extent.</p>
        
        <p n="10">Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. In the mean time the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased. At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several serious émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs "for the conviction of the assassin," or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated, "for the conviction of any one of the assassins." In the proclamation setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture. The entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described.</p>
        
        <p n="11">No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light. But although, in one or two instances, arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith. Strange as it may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind, reached the ears of <char>Dupin</char> and myself. Engaged in researches which had absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad, or received a visiter, or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers. The first intelligence of the murder was brought us by G-- --, in person. He called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18 --, and remained with us until late in the night. He had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins. His reputation -- <fos type="metaphor">so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air</fos> -- was at stake. Even his honor was concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of <char>Dupin</char>, and made him a direct, and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative.</p>
        
        <p n="12">The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether provisional. This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in possession. He discoursed much, and beyond doubt, learnedly; <fos type="personification">while I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away.</fos> <char>Dupin</char>, sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment of respectful attention. He wore spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occasional glance beneath their green glasses, sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or eight <fos type="metaphor">leaden-footed hours </fos>which immediately preceded the departure of the Prefect.</p>
        
        <p n="13">In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy of every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair. Freed from all that was positively disproved, this mass of information stood thus:</p>
        
        <p n="14"><char>Marie Rogêt</char> left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, about nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, June the twenty-second, 18 --. In going out, she gave notice to a <char>Monsieur Jacques St. Eustache,</char>* and to him only, of her intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes. The Rue des Drômes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct course possible, from the pension of <char>Madame Rogêt</char>. <char>St. Eustache</char> was the accepted suitor of<char> Marie</char>, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at the pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to have escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt's, (as she had done under similar circumstances before,) he did not think it necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on, <char>Madame Rogêt</char> (who was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age,) was heard to express a fear <quote>"that she should never see<char> Marie</char> again;"</quote> but this observation attracted little attention at the time.</p>
        
        <p n="15">On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des Drômes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city, and its environs. It was not, however, until the fourth day from the period of her disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. On this day, (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June,) a <char>Monsieur Beauvais</char>, who, with a friend, had been making inquiries for<char> Marie</char> near the Barrière du Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen, who had found it floating in the river. Upon seeing the body, <char>Beauvais</char>, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the perfumery-girl. His friend recognized it more promptly.</p>
        
        <p n="16"><fos type="imagery">The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the mouth</fos>. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned. There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue.<fos type="imagery"> About the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers.</fos> <fos type="imagery">The arms were bent over on the chest and were rigid.</fos> <fos type="imagery">The right hand was clenched; the left partially open.</fos> <fos type="imagery">On the left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution.</fos> <fos type="imagery">A part of the right wrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more especially at the shoulder-blades</fos>. In bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the excoriations had been effected by this.<fos type="imagery"> The flesh of the neck was much swollen</fos>. There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect of blows.<fos type="imagery"> A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay just under the left ear</fos>. This alone would have sufficed to produce death. The medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased. She had been subjected, it said, to brutal violence. The corpse was in such condition when found, that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition by friends.</p>
        
        <p n="17"><fos type="imagery">The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered</fos>. <fos type="imagery">In the outer garment, a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist, but not torn off</fos>. <fos type="imagery">It was wound three times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.</fos> <fos type="imagery">The dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out -- torn very evenly and with great care.</fos> <fos type="imagery">It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Over this muslin slip and the slip of lace, the strings of a bonnet were attached; the bonnet being appended.</fos> <fos type="imagery">The knot by which the strings of the bonnet were fastened, was not a lady's, but a slip or sailor's knot</fos>.</p>
        
        <p n="18">After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the Morgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted. A weekly paper,* however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was disinterred, and a re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already noted. The clothes, however, were now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.</p>
        
        <p n="19">Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals were arrested and discharged. <char>St. Eustache</char> fell especially under suspicion; and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts during the Sunday on which<char> Marie</char> left home. Subsequently, however, he submitted to <char>Monsieur G----</char>, affidavits, accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. As time passed and no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated, and journalists busied themselves in suggestions. Among these, the one which attracted the most notice, was the idea that <char>Marie Rogêt</char> still lived -- that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages which embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal translations from L'Etoile,* a paper conducted, in general, with much ability.</p>
        
        <p n="20"><quote>"<char>Mademoiselle Rogêt</char> left her mother's house on Sunday morning, June the twenty-second, 18--, with the ostensible purpose of going to see her aunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Drômes. From that hour, nobody is proved to have seen her. There is no trace or tidings of her at all. * * * * There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who saw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother's door. * * * * Now, though we have no evidence that <char>Marie Rogêt</char> was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof that, up to that hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière du Roule. This was, even if we presume that <char>Marie Rogêt</char> was thrown into the river within three hours after she left her mother's house, only three days from the time she left her home -- three days to an hour. But it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight. Those who are guilty of such horrid crimes, choose darkness rather than light. * * * * Thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of <char>Marie Rogêt</char>, it could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at the outside. All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again, if let alone. Now, we ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature? * * * * If the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead two days. And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="21">The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the water <quote>"not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,"</quote> because it was so far decomposed that <char>Beauvais</char> had great difficulty in recognizing it. This latter point, however, was fully disproved. I continue the translation:</p>
        
        <p n="22"><quote>"What, then, are the facts on which <char>M. Beauvais</char> says that he has no doubt the body was that of <char>Marie Rogêt</char>? He ripped up the gown sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. The public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars. He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it -- something as indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined --<fos type="metaphor"> as little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve.</fos> M. Beauvais did not return that night, but sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening, that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. If we allow that Madame Rogêt, from her age and grief, could not go over, (which is allowing a great deal,) there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of<char> Marie</char>. Nobody went over. There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, that reached even the occupants of the same building. M. St. Eustache, the lover and intended husband of<char> Marie</char>, who boarded in her mother's house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it. For an item of news like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="23">In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of<char> Marie</char>, inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. Its insinuations amount to this: -- that<char> Marie</char>, with the connivance of her friends, had absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and that these friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death. But L'Etoile was again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty; that <char>St. Eustache</char>, so far from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that <char>M. Beauvais</char> prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending the examination at the disinterment. Moreover, although it was stated by <char>L'Etoile</char>, that the corpse was re-interred at the public expense -- that an advantageous offer of private sepulture was absolutely declined by the family -- and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial: -- although, I say, all this was asserted by <char>L'Etoile</char> in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey -- yet all this was satisfactorily disproved. In a subsequent number of the paper, an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor says:</p>
        
        <p n="24"><quote>"Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told that, on one occasion, while a <char>Madame B----</char> was at <char>Madame Rogêt</char>'s house, <char>M. Beauvais,</char> who was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and that she, <char>Madame B.</char>, must not say anything to the gendarme until he returned, but let the matter be for him. * * * * In the present posture of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head. A single step cannot be taken without <char>M. Beauvais</char>; for, go which way you will, you run against him. * * * * * For some reason, he determined that nobody shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="25">By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon <char>Beauvais</char>. A visiter at his office, a few days prior to the girl's disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a rose in the key-hole of the door, and the name <quote>"Marie "</quote> inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand.</p>
        
        <p n="26">The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the newspapers, seemed to be, that<char> Marie</char> had been the victim of a gang of desperadoes -- that by these she had been borne across the river, maltreated and murdered. <char>Le Commerciel</char>,* however, a print of extensive influence, was earnest in combating this popular idea. I quote a passage or two from its columns:</p>
        
        <p n="27"><quote>"We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so far as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule. It is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew her. It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out. * * * It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or to the Rue des Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother's door, and there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the murder had been committed at the Barrière du Roule, there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement. The fact that the body was found floating near the Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water. * * * * * A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="28">A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least, the chief portion of <char>Le Commerciel</char>'s argument. Two small boys, sons of a <char>Madame Deluc</char>, while roaming among the woods near the Barrière du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name <quote>"<char>Marie Rogêt</char>."</quote> Fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.</p>
        
        <p n="29">A weekly paper, <char>Le Soleil</char>,* had the following comments upon this discovery -- comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole Parisian press:</p>
        
        <p n="30"><quote>"The things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain, and stuck together from mildew. <fos type="imagery">The grass had grown around and over some of them.</fos> The silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within. <fos type="imagery">The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened.</fos> * * * * <fos type="imagery">The pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not the hem.</fos> <fos type="imagery">They looked like strips torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from the ground</fos>. * * * * * There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="31">Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared. <char>Madame Deluc</char> testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the river, opposite the Barrière du Roule. The neighborhood is secluded -- particularly so. It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards from the city, who cross the river in boats. About three o'clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied by a young man of dark complexion. The two remained here for some time. On their departure, they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity. Madame Deluc's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative. A scarf was particularly noticed. Soon after the departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and re-crossed the river as if in great haste.</p>
        
        <p n="32">It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that <char>Madame Deluc</char>, as well as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn. The screams were violent but brief. <char>Madame D.</char> recognized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket, but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse. An omnibus-driver, <char>Valence</char>,* now also testified that he saw <char>Marie Rogêt</char> cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in question, in company with a young man of dark complexion. He, <char>Valence</char>, knew<char> Marie</char>, and could not be mistaken in her identity. The articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of<char> Marie</char>.</p>
        
        <p n="33">The items of evidence and information thus collected by myself, from the newspapers, at the suggestion of <char>Dupin</char>, embraced only one more point -- but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence. It appears that, immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described, the lifeless, or nearly lifeless body of<char> St. Eustache</char>,<char> Marie</char>'s betrothed, was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage. A phial labelled <quote>"laudanum,"</quote> and emptied, was found near him. His breath gave evidence of the poison. He died without speaking. Upon his person was found a letter, briefly stating his love for<char> Marie</char>, with his design of self-destruction.</p>
        
        <p n="34"><conversation speaker="dupin">"I need scarcely tell you,"</conversation> said <char>Dupin</char>, as he finished the perusal of my notes, "<conversation speaker="dupin">that this is a far more intricate case than that of the Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect. This is an ordinary, although an atrocious instance of crime. There is nothing peculiarly outré about it. You will observe that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should have been considered difficult, of solution. Thus, at first, it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmidons of G---- were able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed. They could picture to their imaginations a mode -- many modes -- and a motive -- many motives; and because it was not impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one, they have taken it for granted that one of them must. But the ease with which these variable fancies were entertained, and the very plausibility which each assumed, should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend elucidation. I have before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the true, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not so much 'what has occurred?' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before?' In the investigations at the house of Madame L'Espanaye,* the agents of G---- were discouraged and confounded by that very unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have afforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="35">In the case of <char>Madame L'Espanaye</char> and her daughter, there was, even at the beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder had been committed. The idea of suicide was excluded at once. Here, too, we are freed, at the commencement, from all supposition of self-murder. The body found at the Barrière du Roule, was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point. But it has been suggested that the corpse discovered, is not that of the <char>Marie Rogêt</char> for the conviction of whose assassin, or assassins, the reward is offered, and respecting whom, solely, our agreement has been arranged with the Prefect. We both know this gentleman well. It will not do to trust him too far. If, dating our inquiries from the body found, and thence tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual than<char> Marie</char>; or, if starting from the living<char> Marie</char>, we find her, yet find her unassassinated -- in either case we lose our labor; since it is Monsieur G---- with whom we have to deal. For our own purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with the <char>Marie Rogêt</char> who is missing.</p>
        
        <p n="36">With the public the arguments of <char>L'Etoile</char> have had weight; and that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subject --'several of the morning papers of the day,' it says,'speak of the conclusive article in Monday's Etoile.' To me, this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its inditer. We should bear in mind that, in general, it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation -- to make a point -- than to further the cause of truth. The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former. The print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion (however well founded this opinion may be) earns for itself no credit with the mob. The mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the epigram which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of merit.</p>
        
        <p n="37">What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and melodrame of the idea, that <char>Marie Rogêt</char> still lives, rather than any true plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to <char>L'Etoile</char>, and secured it a favorable reception with the public. Let us examine the heads of this journal's argument; endeavoring to avoid the incoherence with which it is originally set forth.</p>
        
        <p n="38">The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the interval between<char> Marie</char>'s disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse, that this corpse cannot be that of<char> Marie</char>. The reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at once, an object with the reasoner. In the rash pursuit of this object, he rushes into mere assumption at the outset. 'It is folly to suppose,' he says, 'that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.' We demand at once, and very naturally, why? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed within five minutes after the girl's quitting her mother's house? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period of the day? There have been assassinations at all hours. But, had the murder taken place at any moment between nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, and a quarter before midnight, there would still have been time enough 'to throw the body into the river before midnight.' This assumption, then, amounts precisely to this -- that the murder was not committed on Sunday at all -- and, if we allow L'Etoile to assume this, we may permit it any liberties whatever. The paragraph beginning 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, etc.,' however it appears as printed in <char>L'Etoile</char>, may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the brain of its inditer -- 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on the body, could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight; it is folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same time, (as we are resolved to suppose,) that the body was not thrown in until after midnight' -- a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed.</p>
        
        <p n="39"><conversation speaker="dupin">"Were it my purpose,"</conversation> continued <char>Dupin</char>, "<conversation speaker="dupin">merely to make out a case against this passage of <char>L'Etoile's</char> argument, I might safely leave it where it is. It is not, however, with <char>L'Etoile</char> that we have to do, but with the truth. The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated: but it is material that we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have obviously intended, and failed to convey. It was the design of the journalist to say that, at whatever period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was committed, it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight. And herein lies, really, the assumption of which I complain. It is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position, and under such circumstances, that the bearing it to the river became necessary. Now, the assassination might have taken place upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to, at any period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal. You will understand that I suggest nothing here as probable, or as cöincident with my own opinion. My design, so far, has no reference to the facts of the case. I wish merely to caution you against the whole tone of L'Etoile's suggestion, by calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="40">Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions; having assumed that, if this were the body of<char> Marie</char>, it could have been in the water but a very brief time; the journal goes on to say:</p>
        
        <p n="41">'All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.'</p>
        
        <p n="42">These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in Paris, with the exception of Le Moniteur.* This latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to 'drowned bodies' only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by <char>L'Etoile</char>. But there is something excessively unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of <char>Le Moniteur</char>, to rebut the general assertion of <char>L'Etoile</char>, by a citation of particular instances militating against that assertion. Had it been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three days, these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions to <char>L'Etoile</char>'s rule, until such time as the rule itself should be confuted. Admitting the rule, (and this Le Moniteur does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the argument of L'Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three days; and this probability will be in favor of <char>L'Etoile</char>'s position until the instances so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule.</p>
        
        <p n="43">You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the rationale of the rule. Now the human body, in general, is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from sea. But, leaving this tide out of question, it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh water, of their own accord. Almost any one, falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own -- that is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as possible. The proper position for one who cannot swim, is the upright position of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface. Thus circumstanced, we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion. It is evident, however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate. An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about. Now, in the struggles of one unused to swimming, the arms are invariably thrown upwards, while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position. The result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs. Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them. This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. Such individuals float even after drowning.</p>
        
        <p n="44">The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces. This effect is brought about by decomposition, or otherwise. The result of decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving the puffed appearance which is to so horrible. When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. But decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances -- is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death. Thus it is evident that we can assign no period, with any thing like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition. Under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour; under others, it might not take place at all. There are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption; the Bi-chloride of Mercury is one. But, apart from decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation of gas within the stomach, from the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter (or within other cavities from other causes) sufficient to induce a distension which will bring the body to the surface. The effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing; or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue; allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas.</p>
        
        <p n="45">Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we can easily test by it the assertions of L'Etoile. 'All experience shows,' says this paper, 'that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.'</p>
        
        <p n="46">The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence and incoherence. All experience does not show that 'drowned bodies' require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface. Both science and experience show that the period of their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If, moreover, a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon, it will not'sink again if let alone,' until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made between 'drowned bodies,' and 'bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.' Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes them all in the same category. I have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water, and that he would not sink at all, except for the struggles by which he elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath while beneath the surface -- gasps which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs. But these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body 'thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.' Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general rule, would not sink at all -- a fact of which L'Etoile is evidently ignorant. When decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent -- when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones -- then, indeed, but not till then, should we lose sight of the corpse.</p>
        
        <p n="47">And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found could not be that of <char>Marie Rogêt</char>, because, three days only having elapsed, this body was found floating? If drowned, being a woman, she might never have sunk; or having sunk, might have re-appeared in twenty-four hours, or less. But no one supposes her to have been drowned; and, dying before being thrown into the river, she might have been found floating at any period afterwards whatever.</p>
        
        <p n="48"><conversation speaker="L'Etoile">'But,</conversation>' says <char>L'Etoile</char>, <conversation speaker="L'Etoile">'<fos type="imagery">if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers.'</fos> Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the reasoner. He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to his theory -- viz: that the body was kept on shore two days, suffering rapid decomposition -- more rapid than if immersed in water. He supposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances it could so have appeared. He is accordingly in haste to show that it was not kept on shore; for, if so,'some trace would be found on shore of the murderers.'</conversation> I presume you smile at the sequitur. You cannot be made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply traces of the assassins. Nor can I.</p>
        
        <p n="49"><quote>" 'And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,'</quote> continues our journal, <quote>'that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken.' Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought! No one -- not even L'Etoile -- disputes the murder committed on the body found. The marks of violence are too obvious. It is our reasoner's object merely to show that this body is not<char> Marie</char>'s. He wishes to prove that<char> Marie</char> is not assassinated -- not that the corpse was not. Yet his observation proves only the latter point. Here is a corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in, would not have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown in by murderers. This is all which is proved, if any thing is. The question of identity is not even approached, and L'Etoile has been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before. 'We are perfectly convinced,' it says, 'that the body found was that of a murdered female.'</quote></p>
        
        <p n="50">Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his subject, where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself. His evident object, I have already said, is to reduce, as much as possible, the interval between<char> Marie</char>'s disappearance and the finding of the corpse. Yet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mother's house. 'We have no evidence,' he says, 'that <char>Marie Rogêt</char> was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second.' As his argument is obviously an ex parte one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for had any one been known to see<char> Marie</char>, say on Monday, or on Tuesday, the interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his own ratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the grisette. It is, nevertheless, amusing to observe that L'Etoile insists upon its point in the full belief of its furthering its general argument.</p>
        
        <p n="51">Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the identification of the corpse by Beauvais. In regard to the hair upon the arm, <char>L'Etoile</char> has been obviously disingenuous. <char>M. Beauvais</char>, not being an idiot, could never have urged, in identification of the corpse, simply hair upon its arm. No arm is without hair. The generality of the expression of <char>L'Etoile</char> is a mere perversion of the witness' phraseology. He must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair. It must have been a peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation.</p>
        
        <p n="52"><quote>" 'Her foot,'</quote> says the journal, '<quote>was small -- so are thousands of feet. Her garter is no proof whatever -- nor is her shoe -- for shoes and garters are sold in packages. The same may be said of the flowers in her hat. One thing upon which <char>M. Beauvais</char> strongly insists is, that the clasp on the garter found, had been set back to take it in. This amounts to nothing; for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and fit them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try them in the store where they purchase.' Here it is difficult to suppose the reasoner in earnest. Had <char>M. Beauvais</char>, in his search for the body of<char> Marie</char>, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference to the question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that his search had been successful. If, in addition to the point of general size and contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living<char> Marie</char>, his opinion might have been justly strengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark. If, the feet of<char> Marie</char> being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of probability that the body was that of<char> Marie</char> would not be an increase in a ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative. Add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be'sold in packages,' you so far augment the probability as to verge upon the certain. What, of itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes through its corroborative position, proof most sure. Give us, then, flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we seek for nothing farther. If only one flower, we seek for nothing farther -- what then if two or three, or more? Each successive one is multiple evidence -- proof not added to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or thousands. Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the living used, and it is almost folly to proceed. But these garters are found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by<char> Marie</char>, shortly previous to her leaving home. It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt. What <char>L'Etoile</char> says in respect to this abbreviation of the garter's being an usual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error. The elastic nature of the clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation. What is made to adjust itself, must of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely. It must have been by an accident, in its strictest sense, that these garters of<char> Marie</char> needed the tightening described. They alone would have amply established her identity. But it is not that the corpse was found to have the garters of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her bonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the arm, or her general size and appearance -- it is that the corpse had each, and all collectively. Could it be proved that the editor of L'Etoile really entertained a doubt, under the circumstances, there would be no need, in his case, of a commission de lunatico inquirendo. He has thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of the lawyers, who, for the most part, content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts. I would here observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the intellect. For the court, guiding itself by the general principles of evidence -- the recognized and booked principles -- is averse from swerving at particular instances. And this steadfast adherence to principle, with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception, is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth, in any long sequence of time. The practice, in mass, is therefore philosophical; but it is not the less certain that it engenders vast individual error.</quote></p>
        
        <p n="53">In respect to the insinuations levelled at Beauvais, you will be willing to dismiss them in a breath. You have already fathomed the true character of this good gentleman. He is a busy-body, with much of romance and little of wit. Any one so constituted will readily so conduct himself, upon occasion of real excitement, as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part of the over-acute, or the ill-disposed. <char>M. Beauvais</char> (as it appears from your notes) had some personal interviews with the editor of <char>L'Etoile</char>, and offended him by venturing an opinion that the corpse, notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in sober fact, that of<char> Marie</char>. 'He persists,' says the paper, 'in asserting the corpse to be that of<char> Marie</char>, but cannot give a circumstance, in addition to those which we have commented upon, to make others believe.' Now, without re-adverting to the fact that stronger evidence 'to make others believe,' could never have been adduced, it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood to believe, in a case of this kind, without the ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party. Nothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity. Each man recognizes his neighbor, yet there are few instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his recognition. The editor of <char>L'Etoile</char> had no right to be offended at M. Beauvais' unreasoning belief.</p>
        
        <p n="54"><quote>The suspicious circumstances which invest him, will be found to tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic busy-bodyism, than with the reasoner's suggestion of guilt. Once adopting the more charitable interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose in the key-hole; the 'Marie' upon the slate; the 'elbowing the male relatives out of the way;' the 'aversion to permitting them to see the body;' the caution given to Madame B----, that she must hold no conversation with the gendarme until his return (Beauvais'); and, lastly, his apparent determination 'that nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except himself.' It seems to me unquestionable that Beauvais was a suitor of<char> Marie</char>'s; that she coquetted with him; and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence. I shall say nothing more upon this point; and, as the evidence fully rebuts the assertion of L'Etoile, touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother and other relatives -- an apathy inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the perfumery-girl -- we shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to our perfect satisfaction."</quote></p>
        
        <p n="55"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"And what,"</conversation> I here demanded, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"do you think of the opinions of Le Commerciel?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="56">That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any which have been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from the premises are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two instances, at least, are founded in imperfect observation. Le Commerciel wishes to intimate that<char> Marie</char> was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from her mother's door. 'It is impossible,' it urges, 'that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her.' This is the idea of a man long resident in Paris -- a public man -- and one whose walks to and fro in the city, have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices. He is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own bureau, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he compares his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great difference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in her walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his. This could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying, methodical character, and within the same species of limited region as are his own. He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own. But the walks of<char> Marie</char> may, in general, be supposed discursive. In this particular instance, it will be understood as most probable, that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her accustomed ones. The parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of Le Commerciel would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals' traversing the whole city. In this case, granting the personal acquaintances to be equal, the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal rencounters would be made. For my own part, I should hold it not only as possible, but as very far more than probable, that<char> Marie</char> might have proceeded, at any given period, by any one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt, without meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was known. In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris, and the entire population of Paris itself.</p>
        
        <p n="57">But whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of Le Commerciel, will be much diminished when we take into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad. 'It was when the streets were full of people,' says Le Commerciel, 'that she went out.' But not so. It was at nine o'clock in the morning. Now at nine o'clock of every morning in the week, with the exception of Sunday, the streets of the city are, it is true, thronged with people. At nine on Sunday, the populace are chiefly within doors preparing for church. No observing person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, from about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath. Between ten and eleven the streets are thronged, but not at so early a period as that designated.</p>
        
        <p n="58">There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation on the part of Le Commerciel. 'A piece,' it says, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long, and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done, by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.' Whether this idea is, or is not well founded, we will endeavor to see hereafter; but by 'fellows who have no pocket-handkerchiefs' the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians. These, however, are the very description of people who will always be found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts. You must have had occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable, of late years, to the thorough blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief.</p>
        
        <p n="59"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"And what are we to think,"</conversation> I asked, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"of the article in Le Soleil?"</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="60"><fos type="metaphor">That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot -- in which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race.</fos> He has merely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion; collecting them, with a laudable industry, from this paper and from that. 'The things had all evidently been there,' he says,' at least, three or four weeks, and there can be no doubt that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered.' The facts here re-stated by Le Soleil, are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject, and we will examine them more particularly hereafter in connexion with another division of the theme.</p>
        
        <p n="61">At present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations. You cannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the examination of the corpse. To be sure, the question of identity was readily determined, or should have been; but there were other points to be ascertained. Had the body been in any respect despoiled? Had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving home? if so, had she any when found? These are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence; and there are others of equal moment, which have met with no attention. We must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry. The case of St. Eustache must be re-examined. I have no suspicion of this person; but let us proceed methodically. We will ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the affidavits in regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday. Affidavits of this character are readily made matter of mystification. Should there be nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss <char>St. Eustache</char> from our investigations. His suicide, however corroborative of suspicion, were there found to be deceit in the affidavits, is, without such deceit, in no respect an unaccountable circumstance, or one which need cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary analysis.</p>
        
        <p n="62">In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior points of this tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts. Not the least usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events. It is the mal-practice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy. Yet experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant. It is through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely through its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me. The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical to base, upon what has been, a vision of what is to be. Accident is admitted as a portion of the substructure. We make chance a matter of absolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and unimagined, to the mathematical formulae of the schools.</p>
        
        <p n="63">I repeat that it is no more than fact, that the larger portion of all truth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but in accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this fact, that I would divert inquiry, in the present case, from the trodden and hitherto unfruitful ground of the event itself, to the contemporary circumstances which surround it. While you ascertain the validity of the affidavits, I will examine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done. So far, we have only reconnoitred the field of investigation; but it will be strange indeed if a comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of the public prints, will not afford us some minute points which shall establish a direction for inquiry.</p>
        
        <p n="64">In pursuance of <char>Dupin</char>'s suggestion, I made scrupulous examination of the affair of the affidavits. The result was a firm conviction of their validity, and of the consequent innocence of <char>St. Eustache</char>. In the mean time my friend occupied himself, with what seemed to me a minuteness altogether objectless, in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files. At the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts:</p>

It was given out by Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother, that she had merely been on a visit to some friend in the country; and the affair was speedily hushed up.

A gentleman, with his wife and daughter, engaged, about dusk, the services of six young men, who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the Seine, to convey him across the river. Upon reaching the opposite shore, the three passengers stepped out, and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat, when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol. She returned for it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream, gagged, brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her parents. The villains have escaped for the time, but the police are upon their trail, and some of them will soon be taken."</quote> -- Morning Paper -- June 25.</p>

        <p n="71">Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand. I waited for some explanation from <char>Dupin</char>.</p>
        
        <p n="72"><conversation speaker="dupin">"It is not my present design,"</conversation> he said, <conversation speaker="dupin">"to dwell upon the first and second of these extracts. I have copied them chiefly to show you the extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can understand from the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any respect, with an examination of the naval officer alluded to. Yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance of<char> Marie</char>, there is no supposable connection. Let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed. We are now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know that an elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the betrayer's advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual -- we are prepared to regard it as a 'making up' of the old amour, rather than as the commencement of a new one. The chances are ten to one, that he who had once eloped with<char> Marie</char>, would again propose an elopement, rather than that she to whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual, should have them made to her by another. And here let me call your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first ascertained, and the second supposed elopement, is a few months more than the general period of the cruises of our men-of-war. Had the lover been interrupted in his first villany by the necessity of departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished -- or not yet altogether accomplished by him? Of all these things we know nothing.</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="73">You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was no elopement as imagined. Certainly not -- but are we prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design? Beyond <char>St. Eustache</char>, and perhaps <char>Beauvais</char>, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable suitors of<char> Marie</char>. Of none other is there any thing said. Who, then, is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom<char> Marie</char> meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence, that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barrière du Roule? Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know nothing? And what means the singular prophecy of Madame Rogêt on the morning of<char> Marie</char>'s departure? -- 'I fear that I shall never see<char> Marie</char> again.'</p>
        
        <p n="74">But if we cannot imagine <char>Madame Rogêt</char> privy to the design of elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl? Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Drômes, and <char>St. Eustache</char> was requested to call for her at dark. Now, at first glance, this fact strongly militates against my suggestion; -- but let us reflect. That she did meet some companion, and proceed with him across the river, reaching the Barrière du Roule at so late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon, is known. But in consenting so to accompany this individual, (for whatever purpose -- to her mother known or unknown, )<fos type="metaphor"> she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor,</fos> <char>St. Eustache</char>, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des Drômes, he should find that she had not been there, and when, moreover, upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence from home. She must have thought of these things, I say. She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all. She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we suppose her not intending to return.</p>
        
        <p n="75">We may imagine her thinking thus -- 'I am to meet a certain person for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known only to myself. It is necessary that there be no chance of interruption -- there must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit -- I will give it to be understood that I shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the Rue des Drômes -- I will tell <char>St. Eustache</char> not to call for me until dark -- in this way, my absence from home for the longest possible period, without causing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain more time than in any other manner. If I bid <char>St. Eustache</char> call for me at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but, if I wholly neglect to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety. Now, if it were my design to return at all -- if I had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question -- it would not be my policy to bid <char>St. Eustache</char> call; for, calling, he will be sure to ascertain that I have played him false -- a fact of which I might keep him for ever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes. But, as it is my design never to return -- or not for some weeks -- or not until certain concealments are effected -- the gaining of time is the only point about which I need give myself any concern.'</p>
        
        <p n="76">You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion in relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards. Now, the popular opinion, under certain conditions, is not to be disregarded. When arising of itself -- when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner -- we should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius. In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I would abide by its decision. But it is important that we find no palpable traces of suggestion. The opinion must be rigorously the public's own; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain. In the present instance, it appears to me that this 'public opinion,' in respect to a gang, has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts. All Paris is excited by the discovered corpse of<char> Marie</char>, a girl young, beautiful and notorious. This corpse is found, bearing marks of violence, and floating in the river. But it is now made known that, at the very period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased, although less in extent, was perpetuated, by a gang of young ruffians, upon the person of a second young female. Is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown? This judgment awaited direction, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it!<char> Marie</char>, too, was found in the river; and upon this very river was this known outrage committed. The connexion of the two events had about it so much of the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it. But, in fact, the one atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence that the other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so committed. It would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong, there should have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and appliances, engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the same period of time! Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe?</p>
        
        <p n="77">Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule. This thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road. <fos type="imagery">Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool</fos>. On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief, were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name, '<char>Marie Rogêt</char>.' Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around. The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent struggle.</p>
        
        <p n="78">Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt. That it was the scene, I may or I may not believe -- but there was excellent reason for doubt. Had the true scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested, in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to redivert this attention. And thus, the thicket of the Barrière du Roule having been already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they were found, might have been naturally entertained. There is no real evidence, although Le Soleil so supposes, that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys. 'They were all mildewed down hard,' says Le Soleil, adopting the opinions of its predecessors, 'with the action of the rain, and stuck together from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them. The silk of the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on being opened.' In respect to the grass having 'grown around and over some of them,' it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party. But grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather, (such as was that of the period of the murder,) as much as two or three inches in a single day. A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single week, be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass. And touching that mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously insists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew? Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus, of which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within twenty-four hours?</p>
        
        <p n="79">Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles had been 'for at least three or four weeks' in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact. On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified, for a longer period than a single week -- for a longer period than from one Sunday to the next. Those who know any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion, unless at a great distance from its suburbs. Such a thing as an unexplored, or even an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not for a moment to be imagined. Let any one who, being at heart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis -- let any such one attempt, even during the weekdays, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us. At every second step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards. He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all in vain. Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound -- here are the temples most desecrate. With sickness of the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution. But if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week, how much more so on the Sabbath! It is now especially that, released from the claims of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of  crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not through love of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way of escape from the restraints and conventionalities of society. He desires less the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter license of the country. Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of the woods, he indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of his boon companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity -- the joint offspring of liberty and of rum. I say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered, for a longer period -- than from one Sunday to another, in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous.</p>
        
        <p n="80">But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage. And, first, let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles. Collate this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers. You will find that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications sent to the evening paper. These communications, although various, and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point -- viz., the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its scene. Now here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communications, by the guilty authors of these communications themselves.</p>
        
        <p n="81">This thicket was a singular -- an exceedingly singular one. It was unusually dense. Within its naturally walled enclosure were three extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and footstool. And this thicket, so full of a natural art, was in the immediate vicinity, within a few rods, of the dwelling of <char>Madame Deluc</char>, whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the sassafras. <fos type="hyperbole">Would it be a rash wager -- a wager of one thousand to one -- that a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon its natural throne?</fos> Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish nature. I repeat -- it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil, that they were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found.</p>
        
        <p n="82">But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged. And, now, let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles. On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf; scattered around, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name, '<char>Marie Rogêt</char>.' Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not-over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally. But it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons. 'There was evidence,' it is said, 'of a struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,' -- but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. 'The pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended. They looked like strips torn off.' Here, inadvertently, Le Soleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase. The pieces, as described, do indeed 'look like strips torn off;' but purposely and by hand. It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is 'torn off,' from any garment such as is now in question, by the agency of a thorn. From the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them, tears them rectangularly -- divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters -- but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece 'torn off.' I never so knew it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from such fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost every case, required. If there be two edges to the fabric -- if, for example, it be a pocket- handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose. But in the present case the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge. To tear a piece from the interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one thorn could accomplish it. But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the other in one. And this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed. If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question. We thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being 'torn off' through the simple agency of 'thorns;' yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn. 'And one part,' too, 'was the hem of the frock!' Another piece was 'part of the skirt, not the hem,' -- that is to say, was torn completely out, through the agency of thorns, from the unedged interior of the dress! These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of reasonable ground for suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of the articles' having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse. You will not have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. There might have been a wrong here, or, more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc's. But, in fact, this is a point of minor importance. We are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the murder. What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly, to bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has, or has not been, the work of a gang.</p>
        
        <p n="83">We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details of the surgeon examined at the inquest. It is only necessary to say that his published inferences, in regard to the number of ruffians, have been properly ridiculed as unjust and totally baseless, by all the reputable anatomists of Paris. Not that the matter might not have been as inferred, but that there was no ground for the inference: -- was there not much for another?</p>
        
        <p n="84">Let us reflect now upon 'the traces of a struggle;' and let me ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate. A gang. But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang? What struggle could have taken place -- what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its 'traces' in all directions -- between a weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffians imagined? The silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over. The victim must have been absolutely passive at their will. You will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the scene, are applicable, in chief part, only against it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual. If we imagine but one violator, we can conceive, and thus only conceive, the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the 'traces' apparent.</p>
        
        <p n="85">And again. I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in the thicket where discovered. It seems almost impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found. There was sufficient presence of mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse; and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself (whose features might have been quickly obliterated by decay,) is allowed to lie conspicuously in the scene of the outrage -- I allude to the handkerchief with the name of the deceased. If this was accident, it was not the accident of a gang. We can imagine it only the accident of an individual. Let us see. An individual has committed the murder. He is alone with the ghost of the departed. He is appalled by what lies motionless before him. The fury of his passion is over, and there is abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed. His is none of that confidence which the presence of numbers inevitably inspires. He is alone with the dead. He trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse. He bears it to the river, but leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt; for it is difficult, if not impossible to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be easy to return for what is left. But in his toilsome journey to the water his fears redouble within him. The sounds of life encompass his path. A dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer. Even the very lights from the city bewilder him. Yet, in time, and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony, he reaches the river's brink, and disposes of his ghastly charge -- perhaps through the medium of a boat. But now what treasure does the world hold -- what threat of vengeance could it hold out -- which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer over that toilsome and perilous path, to the thicket and its blood-chilling recollections? He returns not, let the consequences be what they may. He could not return if he would. His sole thought is immediate escape. He turns his back forever upon those dreadful shrubberies, and flees as from the wrath to come.</p>
        
        <p n="86">But how with a gang? Their number would have inspired them with confidence; if, indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the arrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone are the supposed gangs ever constituted. <fos type="metaphor">Their number, I say, would have prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which I have imagined to paralyze the single man.</fos> Could we suppose an oversight in one, or two, or three, this oversight would have been remedied by a fourth. They would have left nothing behind them; for their number would have enabled them to carry all at once. There would have been no need of return.</p>
        
        <p n="87">Consider now the circumstance that, in the outer garment of the corpse when found, 'a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist, wound three times round the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.' This was done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to carry the body. But would any number of men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient? To three or four, the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but the best possible hold. The device is that of a single individual; and this brings us to the fact that 'between the thicket and the river, the rails of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it!' But would a number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence, for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted over any fence in an instant? Would a number of men have so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the dragging?</p>
        
        <p n="88">And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an observation upon which I have already, in some measure, commented. 'A piece,' says this journal, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.'</p>
        
        <p n="89">I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a pocket-handkerchief. But it is not to this fact that I now especially advert. That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose imagined by Le Commerciel, that this bandage was employed, is rendered apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket; and that the object was not 'to prevent screams' appears, also, from the bandage having been employed in preference to what would so much better have answered the purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as 'found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.' These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially from those of Le Commerciel. The slip was eighteen inches wide, and therefore, although of muslin, would form a strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally. And thus rumpled it was discovered. My inference is this. The solitary murderer, having borne the corpse, for some distance, (whether from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the bandage hitched around its middle, found the weight, in this mode of procedure, too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the burthen -- the evidence goes to show that it was dragged. With this object in view, it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the extremities. It could be best attached about the neck, where the head would prevent its slipping off. And, now, the murderer bethought him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins. He would have used this, but for its volution about the corpse, the hitch which embarrassed it, and the reflection that it had not been 'torn off' from the garment. It was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat. He tore it, made it fast about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the brink of the river. That this 'bandage,' only attainable with trouble and delay, and but imperfectly answering its purpose -- that this bandage was employed at all, demonstrates that the necessity for its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer attainable -- that is to say, arising, as we have imagined, after quitting the thicket, (if the thicket it was), and on the road between the thicket and the river.</p>
        
        <p n="90">But the evidence, you will say, of <char>Madame Deluc</char>, points especially to the presence of a gang, in the vicinity of the thicket, at or about the epoch of the murder. This I grant. I doubt if there were not a dozen gangs, such as described by <char>Madame Deluc</char>, in and about the vicinity of the Barrière du Roule at or about the period of this tragedy. But the gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion, although the somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of <char>Madame Deluc</char>,<fos type="simile"> is the only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old lady as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy</fos>, without putting themselves to the trouble of making her payment. Et hinc illae irae?</p>
        
        <p n="91">But what is the precise evidence of <char>Madame Deluc?</char> 'A gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and recrossed the river as if in great haste.'</p>
        
        <p n="92">Now this 'great haste' very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes of <char>Madame Deluc</char>, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly upon her violated cakes and ale -- cakes and ale for which she might still have entertained a faint hope of compensation. Why, otherwise, since it was about dusk, should she make a point of the haste? It is no cause for wonder, surely, that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to get home, when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm impends, and when night approaches.</p>
        
        <p n="93">I say approaches; for the night had not yet arrived. It was only about dusk that the indecent haste of these 'miscreants' offended the sober eyes of <char>Madame Deluc</char>. But we are told that it was upon this very evening that <char>Madame Deluc</char>, as well as her eldest son, 'heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn.' And in what words does <char>Madame Deluc</char> designate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard? 'It was soon after dark,' she says. But'soon after dark,' is, at least, dark; and 'about dusk' is as certainly daylight. Thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the Barrière du Roule prior to the screams overheard by <char>Madame Deluc</char>. And although, in all the many reports of the evidence, the relative expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just as I have employed them in this conversation with yourself, no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet, been taken by any of the public journals, or by any of the Myrmidons of police.</p>
        
        <p n="94">I shall add but one to the arguments against a gang; but this one has, to my own understanding at least, a weight altogether irresistible. Under the circumstances of large reward offered, and full pardon to any King's evidence, it is not to be imagined, for a moment, that some member of a gang of low ruffians, or of any body of men, would not long ago have betrayed his accomplices. Each one of a gang so placed, is not so much greedy of reward, or anxious for escape, as fearful of betrayal. He betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed. That the secret has not been divulged, is the very best of proof that it is, in fact, a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are known only to one, or two, living human beings, and to God.</p>
        
        <p n="95"><fos type="metaphor">Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis</fos>. We have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of <char>Madame Deluc</char>, or of a murder perpetrated, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule, by a lover, or at least by an intimate and secret associate of the deceased. This associate is of swarthy complexion. This complexion, the 'hitch' in the bandage, and the'sailor's knot,' with which the bonnet-ribbon is tied, point to a seaman. His companionship with the deceased, a gay, but not an abject young girl, designates him as above the grade of the common sailor. Here the well written and urgent communications to the journals are much in the way of corroboration. The circumstance of the first elopement, as mentioned by Le Mercurie, tends to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the 'naval officer' who is first known to have led the unfortunate into crime.</p>
        
        <p n="96">And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued absence of him of the dark complexion. Let me pause to observe that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was no common swarthiness which constituted the sole point of remembrance, both as regards Valence and Madame Deluc. But why is this man absent? Was he murdered by the gang? If so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl? The scene of the two outrages will naturally be supposed identical. And where is his corpse? The assassins would most probably have disposed of both in the same way. But it may be said that this man lives, and is deterred from making himself known, through dread of being charged with the murder. This consideration might be supposed to operate upon him now -- at this late period -- since it has been given in evidence that he was seen with<char> Marie</char> -- but it would have had no force at the period of the deed. The first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce the outrage, and to aid in identifying the ruffians. This policy would have suggested. He had been seen with the girl. He had crossed the river with her in an open ferry-boat. The denouncing of the assassins would have appeared, even to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving himself from suspicion. We cannot suppose him, on the night of the fatal Sunday, both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage committed. Yet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he would have failed, if alive, in the denouncement of the assassins.</p>
        
        <p n="97">And what means are ours, of attaining the truth? We shall find these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed. Let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement. Let us know the full history of 'the officer,' with his present circumstances, and his whereabouts at the precise period of the murder. Let us carefully compare with each other the various communications sent to the evening paper, in which the object was to inculpate a gang. This done, let us compare these communications, both as regards style and MS., with those sent to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais. And, all this done, let us again compare these various communications with the known MSS. of the officer. Let us endeavor to ascertain, by repeated questionings of Madame Deluc and her boys, as well as of the omnibus-driver, Valence, something more of the personal appearance and bearing of the 'man of dark complexion.' Queries, skilfully directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of these parties, information on this particular point (or upon others) -- information which the parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing. And let us now trace the boat picked up by the bargeman on the morning of Monday the twenty-third of June, and which was removed from the barge-office, without the cognizance of the officer in attendance, and without the rudder, at some period prior to the discovery of the corpse. With a proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat; for not only can the bargeman who picked it up identify it, but the rudder is at hand. The rudder of a sail-boat would not have been abandoned, without inquiry, by one altogether at ease in heart. And here let me pause to insinuate a question. There was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat. It was silently taken to the barge-office, and as silently removed. But its owner or employer -- how happened he, at so early a period as Tuesday morning, to be informed, without the agency of advertisement, of the locality of the boat taken up on Monday, unless we imagine some connexion with the navy -- some personal permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute interests -- its petty local news?</p>
        
        <p n="98">In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore, I have already suggested the probability of his availing himself of a boat. Now we are to understand that <char>Marie Rogêt</char> was precipitated from a boat. This would naturally have been the case. The corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore. The peculiar marks on the back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat. That the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the idea. If thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. We can only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off. In the act of consigning the corpse to the water, he would unquestionably have noticed his oversight; but then no remedy would have been at hand. Any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore. Having rid himself of his ghastly charge, the murderer would have hastened to the city. There, at some obscure wharf, he would have leaped on land. But the boat -- would he have secured it? He would have been in too great haste for such things as securing a boat. Moreover, in fastening it to the wharf, he would have felt as if securing evidence against himself. His natural thought would have been to cast from him, as far as possible, all that had held connection with his crime. He would not only have fled from the wharf, but he would not have permitted the boat to remain. Assuredly he would have cast it adrift. Let us pursue our fancies. -- In the morning, the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting -- at a locality, perhaps, which his duty compels him to frequent. The next night, without daring to ask for the rudder, he removes it. Now where is that rudderless boat? Let it be one of our first purposes to discover. With the first glimpse we obtain of it, the dawn of our success shall begin. This boat shall guide us, with a rapidity which will surprise even ourselves, to him who employed it in the midnight of the fatal Sabbath. Corroboration will rise upon corroboration, and the murderer will be traced."</p>
        
        <p n="99">[For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many readers will appear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here omitting, from the MSS. placed in our hands, such portion as details the following up of the apparently slight clew obtained by <char>Dupin</char>. We feel it advisable only to state, in brief, that the result desired was brought to pass; and that the Prefect fulfilled punctually, although with reluctance, the terms of his compact with the Chevalier. Mr. Poe's article concludes with the following words. -- Eds.]</p>
        
        <p n="100">It will be understood that I speak of coincidences and no more. What I have said above upon this topic must suffice. In my own heart there dwells no faith in præter-nature. That Nature and its God are two, no man who thinks, will deny. That the latter, creating the former, can, at will, control or modify it, is also unquestionable. I say "at will;" for the question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power. It is not that the Deity cannot modify his laws, but that we insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification. In their origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in the Future. With God all is Now.</p>
        
        <p n="101">I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of coincidences. And farther: in what I relate it will be seen that between the fate of the unhappy <char>Mary Cecilia Rogers</char>, so far as that fate is known, and the fate of one <char>Marie Rogêt</char> up to a certain epoch in her history, there has existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the reason becomes embarrassed. I say all this will be seen. But let it not for a moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative of<char> Marie</char> from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its dénouement the mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert design to hint at an extension of the parallel, or even to suggest that the measures adopted in Paris for the discovery of the assassin of a grisette, or measures founded in any similar ratiocination, would produce any similar result.</p>
        
        <p n="102">For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it should be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important miscalculations, by diverting thoroughly the two courses of events; very much as, in arithmetic, an error which, in its own individuality, may be inappreciable, produces, at length, by dint of multiplication at all points of the process, a result enormously at variance with truth. And, in regard to the former branch, we must not fail to hold in view that the very Calculus of Probabilities to which I have referred, forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel: -- forbids it with a positiveness strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been long-drawn and exact. This is one of those anomalous propositions which, seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical, is yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain. Nothing, for example, is more difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by a player at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt. A suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once. It does not appear that the two throws which have been completed, and which lie now absolutely in the Past, can have influence upon the throw which exists only in the Future. The chance for throwing sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary time -- that is to say, subject only to the influence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice. And this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with anything like respectful attention. The error here involved -- a gross error redolent of mischief -- I cannot pretend to expose within the limits assigned me at present; and with the philosophical it needs no exposure. <fos type="metaphor">It may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path of Reason through her propensity for seeking truth in detail.</fos></p>

        <p n="1">LET me call myself, for the present, <char>William Wilson</char>. The fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has been already too much an object for the scorn, for the horror, for the detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy?<fos type="alliteration"> Oh, outcast of all outcasts most abandoned!</fos> To the earth art thou not forever dead? to its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations? and a cloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and heaven?</p>
        
        <p n="2">I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch -- these later years -- took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base by degrees. <fos type="simile">From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle.</fos> I shrouded my nakedness in triple guilt. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance -- what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy -- I had nearly said for the pity -- of my fellow-men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have them allow -- what they cannot refrain from allowing -- that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before -- certainly, never thus fell. And it is therefore that he has never thus suffered. Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?</p>
        
        <p n="3">I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own actions.</p>
        
        <p n="4">My earliest recollections of a school-life are connected with a large, rambling, cottage-built, and somewhat decayed building in a misty-looking village of England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep, hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the old, fretted, <fos type="personification">Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="5">It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am -- misery, alas! only too real -- I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance as connected with a period and a locality, when and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.</p>
        
        <p n="6">The house, I have said, was old, irregular, and cottage-built. The grounds were extensive, and an enormously high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain. Beyond it we saw but thrice a week -- once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields -- and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast -- could this be he who of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!</p>
        
        <p n="7">At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges we found a plenitude of mystery, a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more solemn meditation.</p>
        
        <p n="8">The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine, hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed, such as a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holydays.</p>
        
        <p n="9">But the house -- how quaint an old building was this! -- to me how veritably a palace of enchantment! <fos type="hyperbole">There was really no end to its windings, to its incomprehensible subdivisions.</fos> It was impossible, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral branches were innumerable -- inconceivable -- and so returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my residence here I was never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.</p>
        
        <p n="10">The school-room was the largest in the house -- I could not help thinking in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, <quote>"during hours,"</quote> of our principal, the Reverend <char>Dr. Bransby</char>. It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the "Dominie," we would all have willingly perished by the peine forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit of "the classical" usher, one of the <quote>"English and mathematical."</quote> Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, meaningless gashes, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of <fos type="hyperbole">stupendous dimensions </fos>at the other.</p>
        
        <p n="11">Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon -- even much of the outré. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow -- a weak and irregular remembrance -- an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. <fos type="simile">In childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the exergues of the Carthaginian medals.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="12">Yet in fact -- in the fact of the world's view -- how little was there to remember!<fos type="personification"> The morning's awakening,</fos> the nightly summons to bed; the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues -- these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring. <quote>"Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer! "</quote></p>
        
        <p n="13">In truth, the ardency, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendency over all not greatly older than myself; -- over all with one single exception. This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself; -- a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable, for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those every-day appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as <char>William Wilson</char> -- a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted "our set," presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class -- in the sports and <fos type="metaphor"></fos>broils of the play-ground -- to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will -- indeed to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.</p>
        
        <p n="14"><char>Wilson</char>'s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; -- the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority, since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority -- even this equality -- was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only conceive this singular behaviour to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.</p>
        
        <p n="15">Perhaps it was this latter trait in <char>Wilson</char>'s conduct, conjoined with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or should have said, that <char>Wilson</char> was not, in the most remote degree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins, for, after leaving <char>Dr. Bransby</char>'s, I casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1811 -- a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.</p>
        
        <p n="16">It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of <char>Wilson</char>, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel, in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride upon my part, and a veritable dignity upon his own, kept us always upon what are called "speaking terms," while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in me a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards him. They formed a heterogeneous mixture -- some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. It will scarcely be necessary to say, in addition, that <char>Wilson</char> and myself were the most inseparable of companions.</p>
        
        <p n="17">It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into that of a more serious and determined hostility. But my endeavors on this head were by no means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself; -- my rival had a weakness in the faucial or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in my power.</p>
        
        <p n="18"><char>Wilson</char>'s retaliations in kind were many, and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second <char>William Wilson</char> came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must, inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own.</p>
        
        <p n="19">The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I perceived that we were not altogether unlike in general contour of person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the case of <char>Wilson</char> himself), this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent, but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance for myself can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration.</p>
        
        <p n="20">His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner, were, without difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my voice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted, but then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grew the very echo of my own.</p>
        
        <p n="21">How greatly this most <fos type="metaphor">exquisite portraiture</fos> harassed me, (for it could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe. I had but one consolation -- in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavors might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many months, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible, or, more possibly, I owed my security to the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, which in a painting is all the obtuse can see, gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.</p>
        
        <p n="22">I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed towards me, and of his frequent officious interference with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age, and seeming inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, today, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially hated, and too bitterly despised.</p>
        
        <p n="23">As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme, under his distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me.</p>
        
        <p n="24">It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy -- wild,<fos type="personification"> confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn.</fos> I cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me, than by saying I could with difficulty shake off the belief that myself and the being who stood before me had been acquainted at some epoch very long ago; some point of the past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I there held with my singular namesake.</p>
        
        <p n="25">The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several enormously large chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number of the students. There were, however, as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned, many little nooks or recesses, the odds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of <char>Dr. Bransby</char> had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest closets, they were capable of accommodating only a single individual. One of these small apartments was occupied by <char>Wilson</char>.</p>
        
        <p n="26">It was upon a gloomy and tempestuous night of an early autumn, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, that, finding every one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand,<fos type="metaphor"> stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival.</fos> I had been long plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. I looked, and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these -- these the lineaments of <char>William Wilson</char>? I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I gazed -- while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared -- assuredly not thus -- in the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name; the same contour of person; the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility that what I now saw was the result of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.</p>
        
        <p n="27">After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at <char>Dr. Bransby</char>'s, or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them. The truth, the tragedy, of the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses, and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.</p>
        
        <p n="28">I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here -- a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night, for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. <fos type="metaphor">The wine flowed freely,</fos> and there were not wanting other, and perhaps more dangerous, seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice from without of a servant. He said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.</p>
        
        <p n="29">Wildly excited with the potent Vin de Barac, the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through a semicircular window. As I put my foot over the threshold I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and (what then peculiarly struck my mad fancy) habited in a white cassimere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish. Immediately upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the words <quote>"<char>William Wilson</char>!"</quote> in my ear. I grew perfectly sober in an instant.</p>
        
        <p n="30">There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered, syllables, which came with a thousand thronging memories of by-gone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use of my senses he was gone.</p>
        
        <p n="31">Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was this <char>Wilson</char>? -- and whence came he? -- and what were his purposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from <char>Dr. Bransby</char>'s academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit, and annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart -- to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.</p>
        
        <p n="32">Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.</p>
        
        <p n="33">It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main, if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses the gay, the frank, the generous <char>William Wilson</char> -- the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford -- him whose follies (said his parasites) <fos type="alliteration">were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy</fos> -- whose errors but inimitable whim -- whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance?</p>
        
        <p n="34">I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, <char>Glendinning</char> -- rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus -- his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with a gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (<char>Mr. Preston</char>,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.</p>
        
        <p n="35">We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting <char>Glendinning</char> as my sole antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite écarté. The rest of the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. The parvenu, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating -- he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The result, of course, did but prove how entirely <fos type="metaphor">the prey was in my toils;</fos> in less than a single hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to <fos type="hyperbole">a pallor truly fearful.</fos> I say to my astonishment. <char>Glendinning</char> had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of <char>Glendinning</char>, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.</p>
        
        <p n="36">What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound and unbroken silence was maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even own that an <fos type="hyperbole">intolerable weight of anxiety</fos> was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy, folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, of about my own height,<fos type="alliteration"> and closely muffled in a cloak</fos>. The darkness, however, was now total; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.</p>
        
        <p n="37"><conversation speaker="intruder">"Gentlemen,"</conversation> he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, <conversation speaker="intruder">"Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving I am but fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who has to-night won at écarté a large sum of money from Lord <char>Glendinning</char>. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="38">While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he at once departed, and as abruptly as he had entered. Can I -- shall I describe my sensations? Must I say that<fos type="metaphor"> I felt all the horrors of the damned?</fos> Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were found all of the court-cards essential in écarté, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, fac-similes of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, arrondées; the honors being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the breadth of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the length, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.</p>
        
        <p n="39">Any outrageous burst of indignation upon this shameful discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure with which it was received.</p>
        
        <p n="40"><conversation speaker="intruder">"Mr. <char>Wilson</char>,"</conversation> said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, <conversation speaker="intruder">"Mr. <char>Wilson</char>, this is your property."</conversation> (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.) <conversation speaker="intruder">"I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile), for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed we have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford -- at all events, of quitting, instantly, my chambers."</conversation></p>
        
        <p n="41">Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested, by a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious, to a degree of absurd coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature. When, therefore, <char>Mr. Preston</char> reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every particular. The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston, placed it, unnoticed, over my own, left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance, and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.</p>
        
        <p n="42">I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this <char>Wilson</char> in my concerns. Years flew, while I experienced no relief. Villain! -- at Rome, with how untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my ambition! At Vienna, too, at Berlin, and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and <fos type="hyperbole">to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.</fos></p>
        
        <p n="43">And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I demand the questions <quote>"Who is he? -- whence came he? -- and what are his objects?"</quote> But no answer was there found. And now I scrutinized, with a minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions, which, fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!</p>
        
        <p n="44">I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be <char>Wilson</char> what he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher at Eton -- in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford  -- in him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge in Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt -- that in this, my arch-enemy and evil genius, I could fail to recognise the <char>William Wilson</char> of my schoolboy days -- the namesake, the companion, the rival, the hated and dreaded rival at <char>Dr. Bransby</char>'s? Impossible! -- But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama.</p>
        
        <p n="45">Thus far I had succumbed to this imperious domination. The sentiments of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of <char>Wilson</char>, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his will. But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon <fos type="metaphor"> hereditary temper </fos>myrendered me more and more impatient of control. I began to murmur -- to hesitate -- to resist. And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I would submit no longer to be enslaved.</p>
        
        <p n="46">It was at Rome, during the carnival of 18-- , that I attended a masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now the <fos type="metaphor">suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms</fos> irritated me beyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking, let me not say with what unworthy motive, the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence. At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.</p>
        
        <p n="47"><fos type="metaphor">In a perfect whirlwind of wrath,</fos> I turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired, as I had expected, like myself; wearing a large Spanish cloak, and a mask of black silk which entirely covered his features.</p>
        
        <p n="48"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"Scoundrel!"</conversation> I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, <conversation speaker="narrorator">"scoundrel! impostor! accursed villain! you shall not -- you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand,"</conversation> and I broke my way from the room into a small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.</p>
        
        <p n="49">Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence.</p>
        
        <p n="50">The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and the power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.</p>
        
        <p n="51">At this instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror, (so at first it appeared to me in my confusion), now stood where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced, with a feeble and tottering gait, to meet me.</p>
        
        <p n="52">Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist -- it was <char>Wilson</char>, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution. Not thread in all the raiment -- not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of that face which was not, even identically, mine own!   His mask and cloak lay where he had thrown them, upon the floor.</p>
        
        <p n="53">It was <char>Wilson</char>; but he spoke no longer in a whisper; and I could have fancied that I myself was speaking while he said --</p>
        
        <p n="54"><conversation speaker="narrorator">"You have conquered, and I yield. Yet henceforward art thou also dead -- dead to the world and its hopes. In me didst thou exist -- and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself."</conversation></p>
