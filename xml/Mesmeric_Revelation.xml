    <p n="1"> <fos type="metaphor">WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism, its startling
        facts are now almost universally admitted. Of these latter, those who doubt, are your mere
        doubters by profession -- an unprofitable and disreputable tribe.</fos> There can be no more
        absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove, at the present day, that man, by mere
        exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an abnormal condition, of
        which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death, or at least resemble them more
        nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,
        while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly, the
        external organs of sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through
        channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover,
        his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies with
        the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally, that his susceptibility to the
        impression increases with its frequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar
        phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced. </p>
    <p n="2">I say that these -- which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features --
        it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict upon my readers so needless a
        demonstration; to-day. My purpose at present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled,
        even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very remarkable
        substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and myself. </p>
        <p n="3">I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question, (<char ref="Mr.
            Vankirk">Mr.
        Vankirk</char>,) and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had
        supervened. For many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more
        distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of
        Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside. </p>
    <p n="4"><fos type="imagery">The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart, and
        breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma.</fos> In spasms such
        as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres,
        but to-night this had been attempted in vain.</p>
    <p n="5"> As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although
        evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease. </p>
    <p n="6"> "I sent for you to-night," he said, " not so much to administer
        to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which, of
        late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. <fos type="personification">I need not tell you how sceptical I have
        hitherto been on the topic of the soul's immortality. </fos>I cannot deny that there has always
        existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of its
        own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction. With it my reason
        had nothing to do. All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more
        sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own works as
        well as in those of his European and American echoes. The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson,
        for example, was placed in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found
        it logical, but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial
        arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it seemed evident to me
        that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly
        forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in
        perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he will
        never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the
        moralists of England, of France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but
        take no hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will always
        in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will may assent -- the soul --
        the intellect, never. </p>
    <p n="7">"I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed. But
        latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling, until it has come so nearly to
        resemble the acquiescence of reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the
        two. I am enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence. I cannot
        better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to
        perceive a train of ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in
        full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through its effect,
        into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning and its conclusion -- the cause and
        its effect -- are present together. In my natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect
        only, and perhaps only partially, remains. </p>
    <p n="8">
        <fos type="metaphor"> "These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a
            series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized.</fos> <fos type="personification">You have often
            observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker -- the extensive
            knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and
            from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism."</fos>
        
    </p>
    <p n="9"> I consented of course to make this experiment. A few passes threw Mr. Vankirk
        into the mesmeric sleep. <fos type="imagery">His breathing became immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer
        no physical uneasiness.</fos> The following conversation then ensued: --  V. in
        the dialogue representing the patient, and  P. myself. </p>
    <p n="10">
   
            <conversation speaker="P"> P. Are you asleep ?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">> V. Yes -- no I would rather sleep more soundly.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  [After a few more passes.] Do you sleep now ?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  Yes.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  How do you think your present illness will result ?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  [After a long hesitation and <fos type="simile">speaking as if with
                effort</fos>.]<fos type="hyperbole"> I must die.</fos> </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Does the idea of death afflict you ? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  [Very quickly.] No -- no !</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Are you pleased with the prospect ? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is
                no matter. <fos type="metaphor">The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me</fos>.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort
                than I feel able to make. You do not question me properly.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  What then shall I ask ? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  You must begin at the beginning.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  The beginning ! but where is the beginning ?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  You know that the beginning is GOD. [This was said
                in a low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound
                veneration.]</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  What then is God ?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  [Hesitating for many minutes.] I cannot tell. </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Is not God spirit ? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  While I was awake I knew what you meant by 
                    "spirit,"  but now it seems only a word -- such for instance as truth,
                beauty -- a quality, I mean.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  Is not God immaterial ?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">
                 V.  There is no immateriality -- it is a mere word. That which
                is not matter, is not at all -- unless qualities are things.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Is God, then, material ? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  No. [This reply startled me very much.]</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  What then is he ? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  [After a long pause, and mutteringly.] I see -- but
                it is a thing difficult to tell. [Another long pause.] He is not spirit, for he
                exists. Nor is he matter, as you understand it. But there are gradations of matter
                of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the
                grosser. <fos type="personification">The atmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while the
                electric principle permeates the atmosphere.</fos> These gradations of matter increase in
                rarity or fineness, until we arrive at a matter unparticled -- without particles --
                indivisible -- one and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified. The
                ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only permeates all things but impels all things
                -- and thus is all things within itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to
                embody in the word  "thought,"  is this matter in motion.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  The metaphysicians maintain that all action is
                reducible to motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the
                former.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is
                the action of mind -- not of thinking. <fos type="metaphor">The unparticled matter, or God, in
                quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind.</fos> And the power
                of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is, in the unparticled
                matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence; how I know not, and now clearly
                see that I shall never know. But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or
                quality, existing within itself, is thinking. </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Can you give me no more precise idea of what you
                term the unparticled matter ?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">
                 V.  The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses in
                gradation. <fos type="imagery">We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of water, the
                atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous ether. </fos>Now we call all
                these things matter, and embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite
                of this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we
                attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach
                the latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or
                with nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its
                atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom,
                as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight.
                Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to
                regard the ether as an entity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we
                might term it spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether -- conceive a
                matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal,
                and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass -- an
                unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms
                themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity.
                There will be a point -- there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms
                are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely
                coalesce. But the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the
                nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear,
                however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it is impossible to
                conceive spirit, since it is impossible to imagine what is not. When we flatter
                ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely deceived our
                understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                <char ref="P."> P.</char>  There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of
                absolute coalescence; -- and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the
                heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space -- a resistance now ascertained,
                it is true, to exist in some degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to
                have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton. We know that the
                resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their density. <fos type="metaphor">Absolute
                coalescence is absolute density.</fos> Where there are no interspaces, there can be no
                yielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more effectual stop to
                the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or of iron.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  Your objection is answered with an ease which is
                nearly in the ratio of its apparent unanswerability. -- <fos type="imagery">As regards the progress of
                the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or the
                ether through it. </fos>There is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which
                reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage
                through an ether: for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to
                all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those
                astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible
                to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand, about
                that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous
                passage through the orb. In the one case, the retarding force is momentary and
                complete within itself -- in the other it is endlessly accumulative.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  But in all this -- in this identification of mere
                matter with God -- is there nothing of irreverence? [I was forced to repeat this
                question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning.]</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  Can you say why matter should be less reverenced
                than mind? But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the
                very "mind" or "spirit" of the schools, so far as regards its high
                    capacities, and is, moreover, the "matter"  of these schools at the same
                time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of
                matter.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is
                thought?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  In general, this motion is the universal thought of
                the universal mind.<fos type="personification"> This thought creates.</fos> All created things are but the thoughts of
                God.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  You say, "in general." </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  Yes. The universal mind is God. For new
                individualities, matter is necessary.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  But you now speak of "mind" and "matter"
                 as do the metaphysicians.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">
                 V.  Yes -- to avoid confusion. When I say  "mind," I mean
                    the unparticled or ultimate matter; by "matter"  I intend all
                else.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  You were saying that  "for new individualities matter
                    is necessary." </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely
                God. To create individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions
                of the divine mind. Thus man is individualized.<fos type="metaphor"> Divested of corporate investiture,
                he were God.</fos> Now, the particular motion of the incarnated portions of the
                unparticled matter is the thought of man ; as the motion of the whole is that of
                God.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  You say that divested of the body man will be God? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  [After much hesitation.] I could not have said
                this; it is an absurdity.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  [Referring to my notes.] You did say that  "divested
                    of corporate investiture man were God." 
            </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">
                 V.  And this is true. Man thus divested would be God -- would be
                unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested -- at least never will be --
                else we must imagine an action of God returning upon itself -- a purposeless and
                futile action. Man is a creature. Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of
                thought to be irrevocable. </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the
                body?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  I say that he will never be bodiless.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Explain. </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  There are two bodies -- the rudimental and the
                complete ; corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly. What
                we call  "death,"  is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present
                incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected,
                ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant. </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  We, certainly -- but not the worm. The matter of
                which our rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that body;
                or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is
                formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which the ultimate is composed. The
                ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell
                which falls, in decaying, from the inner form; not that inner form itself; but this
                inner form, as well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired
                the ultimate life.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  You have often said that the mesmeric state very
                nearly resembles death. How is this?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">
                 V.  When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles
                the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in
                abeyance, and I perceive external things directly, without organs, through a medium
                which I shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Unorganized? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V. <fos type="metaphor"> Yes; organs are contrivances by which the
                individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of
                matter, to the exclusion of other classes and forms</fos>. The organs of man are adapted
                to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being
                unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one -- the nature of
                the volition of God -- that is to say, the motion of the unparticled matter. You
                will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain.
                This it is not; but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension
                of what it is.<fos type="imagery"> A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.</fos> The
                vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar
                ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain,
                also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it. The motion of this
                latter is thought, of which perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by
                which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this
                external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its
                organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole
                body, (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no
                other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the
                luminiferous; and to this ether -- in unison with it -- the whole body vibrates,
                setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence of
                idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited
                perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs are the cages
                necessary to confine them until fledged.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  You speak of rudimental  "beings." 
                Are there other rudimental thinking beings than man?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">
                <char ref="V."> V. </char> The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebul ,
                planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebul , suns, nor planets, is for
                the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an
                infinity of rudimental beings. But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the
                ultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is
                tenanted by a distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all,
                the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. <fos type="personification">At death, or metamorphosis,
                these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life -- immortality -- and cognizant of all
                secrets but the one, act all things and pass everywhere by mere volition: --
                indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the
                accommodation of which we blindly deem space created -- but that SPACE itself --
                that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the star-shadows
                -- blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of the angels.</fos></conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  You say that  "but for the necessity of the
                    rudimental life"  there would have been no stars. But why this
                necessity? </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  <fos type="personification">In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic
                matter generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law --
                the Divine Volition.</fos> With the view of producing impediment, the organic life and
                matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,) were contrived.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  But again -- why need this impediment have been
                produced?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  The result of law inviolate is perfection -- right
                -- negative happiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive
                pain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and substantiality
                of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a
                certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in the inorganic life is impossible,
                is possible in the organic.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P">
                 P.  But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V"> V.  All things are either good or bad by comparison. A
                sufficient analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of
                pain. Positive pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one point we must have
                suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed.
                But it has been shown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be thus the necessity
                for the organic. The pain of the primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the
                bliss of the ultimate life in Heaven.</conversation>
            <conversation speaker="P"> P.  Still, there is one of your expressions which I
                find it impossible to comprehend --  "the truly substantive vastness of
                    infinity." 
            </conversation>
            <conversation speaker="V">
                 V.  This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic
                conception of the term  "substance" itself. We must not regard it as a
                    quality, but as a sentiment: -- it is the perception, in thinking beings, of the
                    adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many things on the Earth,
                    which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus -- many things visible and
                    tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at
                    all. But to the inorganic beings -- to the angels -- the whole of the
                    unparticled matter is substance; that is to say, the whole of what we term
                    "space"  is to them the truest substantiality; -- the stars, meantime,
                through what we consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in
                proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality,
                eludes the organic.</conversation>
