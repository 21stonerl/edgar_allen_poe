    <p n="1"><fos type="metaphor">I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the<char> king </char>
        was.</fos> He seemed to live only for joking.<fos type="personification"> To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell
        it well, was the surest road to his favor. </fos>Thus it happened that his seven ministers were
        all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They all took after the<char> king
        </char>, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers.
        Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which
        predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a
        lean joker is a rara avis in terris. </p>
    <p n="2"><fos type="metaphor">About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of wit, the<char> king
        </char> troubled himself very little. </fos>He had an especial admiration for breadth in a
        jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it. Over-niceties wearied him. He
        would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the 'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole,
        practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones. </p>
    <p n="3"><fos type="metaphor">At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of
        fashion at court. Several of the great continental 'powers' still retain their 'fools,' who
        wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp
        witticisms, at a moment's notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal
        table.</fos> </p>
    <p n="4"><fos type="metaphor">Our<char> king </char>, as a matter of course, retained his 'fool.' The
        fact is, he required something in the way of folly -- if only to counterbalance the heavy
        wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers -- not to mention himself.</fos> </p>
    <p n="5">His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value was trebled
        in the eyes of the<char> king </char>, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a
        cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would
        have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than
        elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.<fos type="metaphor"> But, as I have
        already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and
        unwieldy -- so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our<char> king
        </char> that, in <char> Hop-Frog </char> (this was the fool's name), he
        possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.</fos> </p>
    <p n="6">I believe the name '<char> Hop-Frog </char>' was not that given to the
        dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the
        several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. <fos type="metaphor">In fact, <char>
            Hop-Frog </char> could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait -- something
        between a leap and a wriggle -- a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of
        course consolation, to the<char> king </char>, for (notwithstanding the
        protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the<char> king
        </char>, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure.</fos> </p>
    <p n="7"><fos type="personification">But although <char> Hop-Frog </char>, through the distortion of his legs,
        could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious
        muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation
        for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity,
        where trees or ropes were in question, or any thing else to climb. </fos><fos type="simile">At such exercises he
        certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.</fos> </p>
    <p n="8">I am not able to say, with precision, from what country
            <char>Hop-Frog</char> originally came. <fos type="hyperbole">It was from some barbarous region,
        however, that no person ever heard of -- a vast distance from the court of our<char>
            king .</char></fos> <char>Hop-Frog</char>, and a young girl very little less
        dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been
        forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as
        presents to the<char> king </char>, by one of his ever-victorious generals. </p>
    <p n="9">Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose
        between the two little captives.<fos type="metaphor"> Indeed, they soon became sworn friends.</fos><char>
            Hop-Frog</char>, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means
        popular, had it not in his power to render <char>Trippetta</char> many services;
        but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was universally
        admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever
        she could, for the benefit of <char>Hop-Frog</char>. </p>
    <p n="10">On some grand state occasion -- I forgot what -- the<char> king </char>
        determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind,
        occurred at our court, then the talents, both of <char>Hop-Frog </char>and
            <char>Trippetta</char> were sure to be called into play.
          <fos type="imagery">  <char>Hop-Frog</char>, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up
        pageants, suggesting novel chars, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that
        nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.</fos> </p>
    <p n="11">The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been fitted up,
        under <char> Trippetta's</char> eye, with every kind of device which could
        possibly give eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of expectation. As for
        costumes and chars, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on
        such points. Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or
        even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere --
        except in the case of the<char> king </char> and his seven minsters. Why they
        hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found
        it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. <fos type="metaphor">At all events, time flew;
        and, as a last resort they sent for <char>Trippetta</char> and
            <char>Hop-Frog.</char> </fos></p>
    <p n="12"><fos type="imagery">When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the<char> king </char>
        they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the
        monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor</fos>. He knew that <char>Hop-Frog</char> was
        not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no
        comfortable feeling. But the<char> king </char> loved his practical jokes, and
        took pleasure in forcing <char>Hop-Frog</char> to drink and (as the<char>
            king </char> called it) 'to be merry.' </p>
    <p n="13"><quote>"Come here, <char>Hop-Frog,</char>"</quote> said he, as the jester
        and his friend entered the room; <quote> "swallow this bumper to the health of your absent
            friends, [here <char>Hop-Frog</char> sighed,] and then let us
            have the benefit of your invention. We want chars -- chars, man -- something
            novel -- out of the way. We are wearied with this everlasting sameness.<fos type="metaphor"> Come, drink! the
            wine will brighten your wits</fos>." </quote></p>
    <p n="14"><char>Hop-Frog</char> endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to
        these advances from the<char> king </char>; but the effort was too much. <fos type="metaphor">It
        happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his 'absent friends'
        forced the tears to his eyes.</fos> <fos type="imagery">Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it,
        humbly, from the hand of the tyrant</fos>. </p>
    <p n="15"><quote> "Ah! ha! ha!" </quote>roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the
        beaker. -- <quote> "See what a glass of good wine can do!<fos type="personification"> Why, your eyes are shining
            already!"</fos> </quote></p>
    <p n="16"><fos type="personification">Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone;</fos><fos type="imagery"> for the effect of wine on his
        excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. He placed the goblet nervously on
        the table, and looked round upon the company with a half -- insane stare.</fos> They all seemed
        highly amused at the success of the<char> king's </char> 'joke.' </p>
    <p n="17"><quote> "And now to business," </quote>said the prime minister, a very fat man. </p>
    <p n="18"><quote> "Yes," </quote>said the <char>King</char>; <quote> <fos type="metaphor">"Come lend us
            your assistance. chars, my fine fellow; we stand in need of chars -- all of us
            -- ha! ha! ha!"</fos> </quote>and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was
        chorused by the seven. </p>
    <p n="19"><char>Hop-Frog </char>also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly. </p>
    <p n="20"><quote> "Come, come," </quote>said the<char> king </char>, impatiently,
            <quote> "have you nothing to suggest?" </quote></p>
    <p n="21"><quote> "I am endeavoring to think of something novel," </quote>replied the dwarf,
        abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. </p>
    <p n="22"><quote> "Endeavoring!" </quote>cried the tyrant, fiercely; <quote> "what do you mean
            by that? Ah, I perceive. You are Sulky, and want more wine. Here, drink this!"
        </quote>and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely
        gazed at it, gasping for breath. </p>

    <p n="23"><quote> "Drink, I say!" </quote>shouted the monster, <quote> "or by the fiends-"
        </quote></p>

    <p n="24">The dwarf hesitated. The<char> king </char> grew purple with rage. <fos type="simile">The
        courtiers smirked. <char>Trippetta</char>, pale as a corpse, advanced to the
        monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend.</fos> </p>
    <p n="25">The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity. He
        seemed quite at a loss what to do or say -- how most becomingly to express his indignation.
        At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the
        contents of the brimming goblet in her face. </p>
    <p n="26">The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her
        position at the foot of the table. </p>
    <p n="27"><fos type="personification">There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling of a leaf,
        or of a feather, might have been heard.</fos> <fos type="imagery">It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and
        protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.</fos> </p>
    <p n="28"><quote> "What -- what -- what are you making that noise for?" </quote>demanded
            the<char> king </char>, turning furiously to the dwarf. </p>
    <p n="29">The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and
        looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant's face, merely ejaculated: </p>
    <p n="30">
        <quote> "I -- I? How could it have been me?" </quote>
    </p>
    <p n="31"><quote> <fos type="metaphor">"The sound appeared to come from without,"</fos> </quote>observed one of the
        courtiers. <quote> "I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his
            cage-wires." </quote></p>
    <p n="32"><quote> "True," </quote>replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion;
            <quote> "but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of
            this vagabond's teeth." </quote></p>
    <p n="33">Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the<char> king </char> was too confirmed a
        joker to object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very
        repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as
        desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very
        perceptible ill effect, <char>Hop-Frog</char> entered at once, and with spirit,
        into the plans for the masquerade. </p>
    <p n="34"><quote> "I cannot tell what was the association of idea," </quote>observed he, very
        tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, <quote> "but just after your
            majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face -- just after your majesty
            had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, there
            came into my mind a capital diversion -- one of my own country frolics -- often enacted
            among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. Unfortunately,
            however, it requires a company of eight persons and-" </quote></p>
    <p n="35"><quote> "Here we are!" </quote>cried the<char> king </char>, laughing at
        his acute discovery of the coincidence; <quote> "eight to a fraction -- I and my seven
            ministers. Come! what is the diversion?" </quote></p>
    <p n="36"><quote> "We call it," </quote>replied the cripple, <quote> <fos type="metaphor">"the Eight Chained
            Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent sport if well enacted."</fos> </quote></p>
    <p n="37"><quote> "We will enact it," </quote>remarked the<char> king </char>,
        drawing himself up, and lowering his eyelids. </p>
    <p n="38"><quote> "The beauty of the game," </quote>continued <char>Hop-Frog</char>,
            <quote> "lies in the fright it occasions among the women." </quote></p>
    <p n="39"><quote> "Capital!" </quote>roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry. </p>
    <p n="40"><quote> "I will equip you as ourang-outangs," </quote>proceeded the dwarf; <quote>
            "leave all that to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of
            masqueraders will take you for real beasts -- and of course, they will be as much
            terrified as astonished." </quote></p>
    <p n="41"><quote> "Oh, this is exquisite!" </quote>exclaimed the<char> king </char>.
            <quote> "<char>Hop-Frog</char>! I will make a man of you."
        </quote></p>
    <p n="42">        <quote> "The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling. You
            are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers. Your majesty cannot conceive
            the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be
            real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of
            delicately and gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is inimitable!" </quote>
    </p>
    <p n="43"><quote> "It must be," </quote>said the<char> king </char>: and the council
        arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of
            <char>Hop-Frog</char>. </p>
    <p n="44">His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective
        enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely
        been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were
        sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was
        thus thought to be secured. </p>
    <p n="45">The<char> king </char> and his ministers were first encased in
        tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage
        of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once
        overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair
        of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flax. A thick
        coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long chain was
        now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the<char> king </char>, and
        tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the
        same manner. When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart
        from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural,
            <char>Hop-Frog</char> passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at
        right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who
        capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo. </p>
    <p n="46"><fos type="imagery">The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very
        lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top. At night (the
        season for which the apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a
        large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or
        elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this
        latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.</fos> </p>
    <p n="47">The arrangements of the room had been left to <char>Trippetta's</char>
        superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer
        judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the
        chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite
        impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the
        guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to
        keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional sconces were
        set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was
        placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the wall -- some fifty
        or sixty altogether. </p>
    <p n="48"><fos type="imagery">The eight ourang-outangs, taking <char>Hop-Frog's</char> advice, waited
        patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before
        making their appearance.</fos> No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed,
        or rather rolled in, all together -- for the impediments of their chains caused most of the
        party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered. </p>
    <p n="49">The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of
            the<char> king </char> with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a
        few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in
        reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women swooned with affright; and had
        not the<char> king </char> taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the
        saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general
        rush was made for the doors; but the<char> king </char> had ordered them to be
        locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had been
        deposited with him. </p>
    <p n="50">While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own
        safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd),
        the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its
        removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came
        within three feet of the floor. </p>
    <p n="51">Soon after this, the<char> king </char> and his seven friends having reeled
        about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of
        course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who
        had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold
        of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle
        diametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook
        from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen
        agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and,
        as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and
        face to face. </p>
    <p n="52">The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm;
        and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud
        shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes. </p>
    <p n="53"><quote> "Leave them to me!" </quote>now screamed <char>Hop-Frog</char>, his
        shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din. <quote> "Leave them to me. I
            fancy I know them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are."
        </quote></p>
    <p n="54">Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when,
        seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre of the
        room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the<char> king </char>s head, and
        thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of
        ourang-outangs, and still screaming: <quote> "I shall soon find out who they are!"
        </quote></p>
    <p n="55">And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter,
        the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about
        thirty feet -- dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them
        suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. <char>Hop-Frog</char>,
        clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the
        eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down
        toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were. </p>
    <p n="56">So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence,
        of about a minute's duration, ensued. It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating
        sound, as had before attracted the attention of the<char> king </char> and his
        councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of <char>Trippetta</char>.
        But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued. It
        came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at
        the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances
        of the<char> king </char> and his seven companions. </p>
    <p n="57"><quote> "Ah, ha!" </quote>said at length the infuriated jester. <quote> "Ah, ha! I
            begin to see who these people are now!" </quote>Here, pretending to scrutinize
            the<char> king </char> more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat
        which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than
        half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the
        multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render
        them the slightest assistance. </p>
    <p n="58">At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb
        higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd
        again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once
        more spoke: </p>
    <p n="59"><quote> "I now see distinctly." </quote>he said, <quote> "what manner of people these
            maskers are. They are a great<char> king </char> and his seven
            privy-councillors, -- a<char> king </char> who does not scruple to strike a
            defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I
            am simply <char>Hop-Frog</char>, the jester -- and this is my last jest."
        </quote></p>
    <p n="60">Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered,
        the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was
        complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and
        indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the
        ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light. </p>
    <p n="61">It is supposed that <char>Trippetta</char>, stationed on the roof of the
        saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they
        effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again. </p>
