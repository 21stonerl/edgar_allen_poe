        <p n="1">IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses -- of the <fos type="symbolism"
                >prima mobilia</fos> of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room
            for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible
            sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them. In
            the <fos type="personification">pure arrogance of the reason</fos>, we have all
            overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want
            of belief -- of faith; -- whether it be <fos type="symbolism">faith in Revelation, or
                faith in the Kabbala.</fos>
            <fos type="irony">The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its
                supererogation.</fos> We saw no need of the impulse -- for the propensity. We could
            not perceive its necessity. We could not understand, that is to say, we could not have
            understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself; -- we could not
            have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity,
            either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure,
            all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man,
            rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs -- to
            dictate purposes to <char ref="God">God</char>. Having thus fathomed, to his
            satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his
            innumerable systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first
            determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the <char ref="Deity">Deity</char> that man
            should eat. We then assigned to man an <fos type="symbolism">organ of
                alimentiveness</fos>, and this organ is the scourge with which the
            <char ref="Deity">Deity</char> compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled
            it to be <char ref="God">God's</char> will that man should continue his species, we discovered an
                <fos type="symbolism">organ of amativeness, forthwith.</fos> And so with
            combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness, -- so, in short,
            with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of
            the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the
            Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in
            principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing
            from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his
            Creator.</p>

        <p n="2">It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we
            must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always
            occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the
            <char ref="Deity">Deity</char> intended him to do. If we cannot comprehend <char ref="God">God</char> in
            his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into
            being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his <fos
                type="personification">substantive moods and phases of creation?</fos></p>

        <p n="3">Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and
            primitive principle of human action, a <fos type="symbolism">p doxical something, which
                we may call perverseness,</fos> for want of a more charistic term. In the sense I
            intend, it is, in fact, a <fos type="simile">mobile without motive</fos>, a motive not
            motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall
            be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to
            say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not. In theory,
            no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With
            certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes <fos type="hyperbole">absolutely
                irresistible.</fos> I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of
            the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us,
            and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong
            for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. It is a
            radical, a primitive impulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we
            persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a
            modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But
            a glance will show the <fos type="irony">fallacy</fos> of this idea. The phrenological
            combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard
            against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is
            excited simultaneously with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well must
            be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of
            combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term <fos type="symbolism"
                >perverseness</fos>, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly
                <fos type="personification">antagonistical sentiment</fos> exists.</p>

        <p n="4">An <fos type="symbolism">appeal to one's own heart</fos> is, after all, the best
            reply to the sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
            questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the
            propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives no
            man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an <fos
                type="personification">earnest desire</fos> to tantalize a listener by
            circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to
            please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the <fos type="hyperbole">most laconic
                and luminous language</fos> is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only
            with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates
            the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain
            involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.
            The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an <fos
                type="hyperbole">uncontrollable longing</fos>, and the longing (to the deep regret
            and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.</p>

        <p n="5">We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be
            ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for
            immediate energy and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the
            work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole <fos type="hyperbole"
                >souls are on fire.</fos> It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it
            off until to-morrow, and why? There is no answer, except that we feel <fos
                type="symbolism">perverse</fos>, using the word with no comprehension of the
            principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but
            with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful,
            because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the <fos
                type="metaphor">moments fly.</fos> The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble
            with the violence of the conflict within us, -- of the definite with the indefinite --
            of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the
                <fos type="personification">shadow which prevails</fos>, -- <fos type="hyperbole">we
                struggle in vain.</fos> The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the
            same time, it is the <char ref="chanticleer">chanticleer</char> -- note to the ghost that has so long
            overawed us. It flies -- it disappears -- we are free. The old energy returns. We will
            labor now. Alas, it is too late! </p>

        <p n="6"><fos type="imagery">We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss
                -- we grow sick and dizzy.</fos> Our first impulse is to <fos type="hyperbole"
                >shrink from the danger.</fos> Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness
            and dizziness and horror become merged <fos type="personification">in a cloud of
                unnamable feeling.</fos> By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes
            shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian
            Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into
            palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet
            it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one <fos type="imagery">which chills
                the very marrow of our bones</fos> with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.
            It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy
            of a fall from such a height. And this fall -- this <fos type="personification">rushing
                annihilation</fos> -- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and
            loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have
            ever presented themselves to our imagination -- for this very cause do we now the most
            vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore
            do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally
            impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a
            Plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost;
            for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If
            there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to <fos
                type="imagery">prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are
                destroyed.</fos></p>

        <p n="7">Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from
            the <fos type="symbolism">spirit of the Perverse</fos>. We perpetrate them because we
            feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle; and
            we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it
            not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.</p>

        <p n="8">I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may
            explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at
            least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting
            this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have
            misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have <fos type="hyperbole">fancied me
                mad.</fos> As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted
            victims of the <fos type="symbolism">Imp of the Perverse.</fos></p>

        <p n="9">It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough
            deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder. I rejected
            a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At
            length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness
            that occurred to <char ref="Madame Pilau">Madame Pilau</char>, through the agency of a candle accidentally
            poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habit of reading in bed.
            I knew, too, that his <fos type="imagery">apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated.</fos>
            But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe the easy artifices
            by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for
            the one which I there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the
            Coroner's verdict was -- "Death by the visitation of God."</p>

        <p n="10">Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea of
            detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself
            carefully disposed. I had left <fos type="personification">no shadow of a clew</fos> by
            which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is
            inconceivable how rich a sentiment of <fos type="personification">satisfaction arose in
                my bosom</fos> as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of
            time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight than
            all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there arrived at length an
            epoch, <fos type="imagery">from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely
                perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because
                it haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common
                thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of
                the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an
                opera.</fos> Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the
            opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself
            pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, "I am
            safe."</p>

        <p n="11">One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of
            murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of petulance, I remodelled
            them thus; "I am safe -- I am safe -- yes -- if I be not fool enough to make open
            confession!"</p>

        <p n="12">No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an <fos type="hyperbole">icy chill
                creep to my heart.</fos> I had had some experience in these fits of perversity,
            (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that in no
            instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now my own casual
            self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which I
            had been guilty, confronted me, <fos type="hyperbole">as if the very ghost of him whom I
                had murdered -- and beckoned me on to death.</fos></p>

        <p n="13">At first, I made an effort to shake off this <fos type="simile">nightmare of the
                soul.</fos>
            <fos type="imagery">I walked vigorously -- faster -- still faster -- at length I ran. I
                felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud.</fos> Every succeeding wave of thought
            overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood that to think, in
            my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my pace. I bounded <fos type="simile"
                >like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.</fos> At length, the populace took
            the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the <fos type="simile">consummation of my
                fate.</fos>
            <fos type="imagery"> Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough
                voice resounded in my ears -- a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I turned --
                I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I
                became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck
                me with his broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my
                soul.</fos></p>

        <p n="14"><fos type="imagery">They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with
                marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before
                concluding the brief,</fos>
            <fos type="personification">but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and
                to hell.</fos> Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial
            conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon. But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these
            chains, and am here! To-morrow I shall be fetterless! -- but where?</p>
