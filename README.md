Project for Digital Humanities Class 

**Team co-ordinator: 21stonerl**
   Responsibilities: This person is responsible for calling and chairing team meetings and making sure everyone has something to work on and knows what that something is. The coordinator must also keep track of what tasks must be finished before other tasks can be done and communicate that to the team in writing. The team coordinator is not the boss. Their job is to help everyone else do their best work.
   
Quality control officer: naw103p
   Responsibilities:  It is easy for teams doing markup to be inconsistent. This person will review everyone else's code and ensure they are all using the schema correctly and consistently. The QCO may also be responsible for writing and continually fine-tuning the schema and communicating any developments to the team.
   
**Subject expert: Abbydopko**
   Responsibilities: Often (not always), the person who proposed the project, the subject expert, a) knows about the topic, b) is prepared to go out and learn more, and c) will educate other team members. A good project requires context and commentary during the process and in the final product.

**Web design/UX maven: bwe6 **
   Responsibilities: The question of how to organize the website should be discussed from day one since the structure of the website is the structure of the project. This team member must ensure that the site is attractive and intuitive.

**Documentation officer: 71mjn**

   Responsibilities: TAll projects should include extensive documentation: what decisions were made and why; what XSLT/XQuery scripts were made to create what HTML pages; what the sources of the texts were; what the research questions were, and how they developed throughout the project. Readers of the website need to understand your questions and findings; further, a future student team might want to pick up where you left off, and they need to know what they're working with.
