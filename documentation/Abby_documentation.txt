For all the text I manually tagged all the figures of speech I saw. 
I also manually tagged the tilte, author, publication dates as well as any extra quotes or notes in the text. 
Then, using regex I tagged all the speech by searching for (dot matches all off)
"."
which found all the people talking and replaced those results with 
<speech>\1</speech>
I did this for all the stories with speech in them. 
I then tagged all the paragraphs using regex. I searched for (dot matches all does not matter)
\n\n
and replaced all with
</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>
I then added the root element and turned the text files into xml files. 
I then created a schema that fit all my documents.
