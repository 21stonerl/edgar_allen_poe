Storeis 8-13
1.Delete all extra text
2. Search for reserved characters & < > to escape them. (I found none)
3.I had to manually tag most of my elements, I manually tagged title, author, year, theme, and fos (figures of speech).

I added my root element called story and numbered them according to our list of stories.

I tried to use regex to find characters but had to manually do those too
	I started by googling common characters in each story
Story8:

Story10:

Story12:

Story12:

After finding all characters I used Regex to find all quotes, in all stories I used:
	Find:
	Replace:
For each paragraph I searched for:
	Find:'.+'
	Replace:
		I then numbered each paragraph individually
