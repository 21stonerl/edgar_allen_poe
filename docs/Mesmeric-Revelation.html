                  <p>  There can be no more
                     absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove, at the present day, that man, by
                     mere
                     exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an abnormal condition,
                     of
                     which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death, or at least resemble them
                     more
                     nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance;
                     that,
                     while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly,
                     the
                     external organs of sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through
                     channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that,
                     moreover,
                     his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies
                     with
                     the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally, that his susceptibility to
                     the
                     impression increases with its frequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar
                     phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced. <span class="metaphor">WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism, its startling
                        facts are now almost universally admitted. Of these latter, those who doubt, are your
                        mere
                        doubters by profession -- an unprofitable and disreputable tribe.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I say that these -- which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features --
                     it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict upon my readers so
                     needless a
                     demonstration; to-day. My purpose at present is a very different one indeed. I am
                     impelled,
                     even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very remarkable
                     substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and myself. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question, (,) and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had
                     supervened. For many months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more
                     distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night
                     of
                     Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> In spasms such
                     as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous
                     centres,
                     but to-night this had been attempted in vain.<span class="imagery">The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart, and
                        breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although
                     evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> "I sent for you to-night," he said, " not so much to administer
                     to my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which,
                     of
                     late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. I cannot deny that there has always
                     existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment
                     of its
                     own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction. With it
                     my reason
                     had nothing to do. All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me
                     more
                     sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own
                     works as
                     well as in those of his European and American echoes. The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr.
                     Brownson,
                     for example, was placed in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout
                     I found
                     it logical, but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial
                     arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it seemed evident
                     to me
                     that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly
                     forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long
                     in
                     perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he
                     will
                     never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion
                     of the
                     moralists of England, of France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise,
                     but
                     take no hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will
                     always
                     in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will may assent -- the
                     soul --
                     the intellect, never. <span class="personification">I need not tell you how sceptical I have
                        hitherto been on the topic of the soul's immortality. </span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed. But
                     latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling, until it has come so nearly
                     to
                     resemble the acquiescence of reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between
                     the
                     two. I am enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence. I
                     cannot
                     better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables
                     me to
                     perceive a train of ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but
                     which, in
                     full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through its effect,
                     into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning and its conclusion -- the
                     cause and
                     its effect -- are present together. In my natural state, the cause vanishing, the
                     effect
                     only, and perhaps only partially, remains. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                      
                     
                     <span class="metaphor"> "These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from
                        a
                        series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized.<span class="metaphor"></span></span><span class="personification">You have often
                        observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker -- the extensive
                        knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and
                        from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism."<span class="personification"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I consented of course to make this experiment. A few passes threw Mr. Vankirk
                     into the mesmeric sleep.  The following conversation then ensued: --  V. in
                     the dialogue representing the patient, and  P. myself. <span class="imagery">His breathing became immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer
                        no physical uneasiness.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I
                     observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat alarmed me, and
                     induced me
                     to awake him at once.I noticed that in less than a minute
                     afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone.  Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only after long pressure from Azrael's
                     hand.
                     Had the sleep-waker, indeed, during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing
                     me
                     from out the region of the shadows?<span class="personification"> No sooner had I done this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all
                        his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired. </span><span class="metaphor">His brow was of the coldness of
                        ice.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
