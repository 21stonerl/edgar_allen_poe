                  <p>IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses -- of the  of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room
                     for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible
                     sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them.
                     In
                     the , we have all
                     overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through
                     want
                     of belief -- of faith; -- whether it be 
                      We saw no need of the impulse -- for the propensity. We could
                     not perceive its necessity. We could not understand, that is to say, we could not
                     have
                     understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself; -- we could
                     not
                     have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity,
                     either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure,
                     all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man,
                     rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs --
                     to
                     dictate purposes to . Having thus fathomed, to his
                     satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his
                     innumerable systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first
                     determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the  that man
                     should eat. We then assigned to man an , and this organ is the scourge with which the
                      compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled
                     it to be  will that man should continue his species, we discovered an
                      And so with
                     combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness, -- so, in short,
                     with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty
                     of
                     the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the
                     Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed,
                     in
                     principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing
                     from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his
                     Creator.<span class="symbolism">prima mobilia<span class="symbolism"></span></span><span class="personification">pure arrogance of the reason<span class="personification"></span></span><span class="symbolism">faith in Revelation, or

               <p>
                  <p>It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we
                     must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always
                     occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the
                      intended him to do. If we cannot comprehend  in
                     his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into
                     being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his <span class="personification">substantive moods and phases of creation?<span class="personification"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and
                     primitive principle of human action, a  for want of a more charistic term. In the sense I
                     intend, it is, in fact, a , a motive not
                     motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this
                     shall
                     be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as
                     to
                     say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not. In theory,
                     no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With
                     certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes  I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of
                     the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels
                     us,
                     and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do
                     wrong
                     for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. It
                     is a
                     radical, a primitive impulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we
                     persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but
                     a
                     modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology.
                     But
                     a glance will show the  of this idea. The phrenological
                     combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard
                     against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well
                     is
                     excited simultaneously with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well
                     must
                     be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification
                     of
                     combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term , the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly
                      exists.<span class="symbolism">p doxical something, which

               <p>
                  <p>An  is, after all, the best
                     reply to the sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
                     questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the
                     propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives
                     no
                     man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an  to tantalize a listener by
                     circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to
                     please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the  is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only
                     with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates
                     the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain
                     involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.
                     The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an , and the longing (to the deep regret
                     and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.<span class="symbolism">appeal to one's own heart<span class="symbolism"></span></span><span class="personification">earnest desire<span class="personification"></span></span><span class="hyperbole">most laconic

                  <p>We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be
                     ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued,
                     for
                     immediate energy and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the
                     work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole  It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it
                     off until to-morrow, and why? There is no answer, except that we feel , using the word with no comprehension of the
                     principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty,
                     but
                     with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful,
                     because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the  The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble
                     with the violence of the conflict within us, -- of the definite with the indefinite
                     --
                     of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it
                     is the
                     , --  The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the

                     overawed us. It flies -- it disappears -- we are free. The old energy returns. We

                     labor now.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> Our first impulse is to  Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness
                     and dizziness and horror become merged  By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes
                     shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian
                     Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into
                     palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and
                     yet
                     it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one  with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.
                     It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy
                     of a fall from such a height. And this fall -- this  -- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and
                     loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which
                     have
                     ever presented themselves to our imagination -- for this very cause do we now the
                     most
                     vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore
                     do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally
                     impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates
                     a
                     Plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost;
                     for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot.
                     If
                     there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to <span class="imagery">We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss

               <p>
                  <p>I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may
                     explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at
                     least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting
                     this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have
                     misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have  As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough
                     deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder. I rejected
                     a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At
                     length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness
                     that occurred to , through the agency of a candle accidentally
                     poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habit of reading in
                     bed.
                     I knew, too, that his 
                     But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe the easy artifices
                     by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making
                     for
                     the one which I there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and
                     the
                     Coroner's verdict was -- "Death by the visitation of God."<span class="imagery">apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea of
                     detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself
                     carefully disposed. I had left  by
                     which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is
                     inconceivable how rich a sentiment of  as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of
                     time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight
                     than
                     all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there arrived at length
                     an
                     epoch,  Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the

                     pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, "I am

                        thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories,
                        of
                        the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an

                  <p>One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of
                     murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of petulance, I remodelled
                     them thus; "I am safe -- I am safe -- yes -- if I be not fool enough to make open
                     confession!"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an  I had had some experience in these fits of perversity,
                     (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that
                     in no
                     instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now my own casual
                     self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which
                     I
                     had been guilty, confronted me, <span class="hyperbole">icy chill
                        creep to my heart.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span><span class="hyperbole">as if the very ghost of him whom I
                        had murdered -- and beckoned me on to death.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>At first, I made an effort to shake off this 
                      Every succeeding wave of thought
                     overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood that to think,
                     in
                     my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my pace. I bounded  At length, the populace took
                     the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the 
                     <span class="simile">nightmare of the
                        soul.<span class="simile"></span></span><span class="imagery">I walked vigorously -- faster -- still faster -- at length I ran. I
                        felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud.</span><span class="simile">like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.<span class="simile"></span></span><span class="simile">consummation of my
                        fate.<span class="simile"></span></span><span class="imagery"> Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough
                        voice resounded in my ears -- a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I turned
                        --
                        I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I
                        became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck
                        me with his broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from
                        my
                        soul.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                      Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial
                     conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon. But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these
                     chains, and am here! To-morrow I shall be fetterless! -- but where?<span class="imagery">They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with
                        marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before
                        concluding the brief,<span class="imagery"></span></span><span class="personification">but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and
                        to hell.<span class="personification"></span></span></p>
