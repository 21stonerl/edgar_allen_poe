            <p>IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses -- of the prima mobilia of the
               human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room
               for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible
               sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them.
               In
               the pure arrogance of the reason, we have all
               overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through
               want
               of belief -- of faith; -- whether it be faith in Revelation, or
               faith in the Kabbala.
               The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its
               supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse -- for the propensity. We could
               not perceive its necessity. We could not understand, that is to say, we could not
               have
               understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself; -- we could
               not
               have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity,
               either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure,
               all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man,
               rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs --
               to
               dictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his
               satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his
               innumerable systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first
               determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man
               should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of
               alimentiveness, and this organ is the scourge with which the
               Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled
               it to be God's will that man should continue his species, we discovered an
               organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with
               combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness, -- so, in short,
               with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty
               of
               the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the
               Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed,
               in
               principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing
               from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his
               Creator.</p>
            <p>It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we
               must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always
               occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the
               Deity intended him to do. If we cannot comprehend God in
               his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into
               being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his substantive
               moods and phases of creation?</p>
            <p>Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and
               primitive principle of human action, a p doxical something, which
               we may call perverseness, for want of a more charistic term. In the sense I
               intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motive not
               motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this
               shall
               be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as
               to
               say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not. In theory,
               no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With
               certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely
               irresistible. I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of
               the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels
               us,
               and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do
               wrong
               for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. It
               is a
               radical, a primitive impulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we
               persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but
               a
               modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology.
               But
               a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological
               combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard
               against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well
               is
               excited simultaneously with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well
               must
               be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification
               of
               combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire
               to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly
               antagonistical sentiment exists.</p>
            <p>An appeal to one's own heart is, after all, the best
               reply to the sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
               questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the
               propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives
               no
               man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to
               tantalize a listener by
               circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to
               please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most laconic
               and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only
               with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates
               the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain
               involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.
               The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable
               longing, and the longing (to the deep regret
               and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.</p>
            <p>We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be
               ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued,
               for
               immediate energy and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the
               work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire.
               It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it
               off until to-morrow, and why? There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using
               the word with no comprehension of the
               principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty,
               but
               with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful,
               because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments
               fly. The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble
               with the violence of the conflict within us, -- of the definite with the indefinite
               --
               of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it
               is the
               shadow which prevails, -- we
               struggle in vain. The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the
               same time, it is the chanticleer -- note to the ghost that has so long
               overawed us. It flies -- it disappears -- we are free. The old energy returns. We
               will
               labor now. Alas, it is too late! </p>
            <p>We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss
               -- we grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger. Unaccountably
               we remain. By slow degrees our sickness
               and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of
               unnamable feeling. By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes
               shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian
               Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into
               palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and
               yet
               it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills
               the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.
               It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy
               of a fall from such a height. And this fall -- this rushing
               annihilation -- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and
               loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which
               have
               ever presented themselves to our imagination -- for this very cause do we now the
               most
               vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore
               do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally
               impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates
               a
               Plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost;
               for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot.
               If
               there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate
               ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are
               destroyed.</p>
            <p>Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from
               the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we
               feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle;
               and
               we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were
               it
               not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.</p>
            <p>I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may
               explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at
               least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting
               this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have
               misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me
               mad. As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted
               victims of the Imp of the Perverse.</p>
            <p>It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough
               deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder. I rejected
               a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At
               length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness
               that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally
               poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habit of reading in
               bed.
               I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated.
               But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe the easy artifices
               by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making
               for
               the one which I there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and
               the
               Coroner's verdict was -- "Death by the visitation of God."</p>
            <p>Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea of
               detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself
               carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew by
               which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is
               inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose in
               my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of
               time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight
               than
               all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there arrived at length
               an
               epoch, from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely
               perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because
               it haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common
               thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories,
               of
               the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an
               opera. Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the
               opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself
               pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, "I am
               safe."</p>
            <p>One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of
               murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of petulance, I remodelled
               them thus; "I am safe -- I am safe -- yes -- if I be not fool enough to make open
               confession!"</p>
            <p>No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill
               creep to my heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity,
               (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that
               in no
               instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now my own casual
               self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which
               I
               had been guilty, confronted me, as if the very ghost of him whom I
               had murdered -- and beckoned me on to death.</p>
            <p>At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the
               soul.
               I walked vigorously -- faster -- still faster -- at length I ran. I
               felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thought
               overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood that to think,
               in
               my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my pace. I bounded like a madman through
               the crowded thoroughfares. At length, the populace took
               the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the consummation of my
               fate.
               Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough
               voice resounded in my ears -- a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I turned
               --
               I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I
               became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck
               me with his broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from
               my
               soul.</p>
            <p>They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with
               marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before
               concluding the brief,
               but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and
               to hell. Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial
               conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon. But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these
               chains, and am here! To-morrow I shall be fetterless! -- but where?</p>

               <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: orange;">The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its
                     supererogation.</a></span> We saw no need of the impulse -- for the propensity. We could
               not perceive its necessity. We could not understand, that is to say, we could not
               have
               understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself; -- we could
               not
               have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity,
               either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure,
               all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man,

               Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled
               it to be God's will that man should continue his species, we discovered an
               <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: violet;">organ of amativeness, forthwith.</a></span> And so with
               combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness, -- so, in short,
               with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty
               of
               the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the
               Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed,
               in
               principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing
               from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his
               Creator.</p>
            <p>It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we
               must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always
               occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the
               Deity intended him to do. If we cannot comprehend God in
               his visible works, how then in his inconceivable thoughts, that call the works into
               being? If we cannot understand him in his objective creatures, how then in his <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">substantive moods and phases of creation?</a></span></p>
            <p>Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and
               primitive principle of human action, a <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: violet;">p doxical something, which
                     we may call perverseness,</a></span> for want of a more charistic term. In the sense I
               intend, it is, in fact, a <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: indigo;">mobile without motive</a></span>, a motive not
               motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this
               shall
               be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as
               to
               say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not. In theory,
               no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With
               certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">absolutely
                     irresistible.</a></span> I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of
               the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels
               us,
               and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do
               wrong
               for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. It
               is a
               radical, a primitive impulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we
               persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but
               a
               modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology.
               But
               a glance will show the <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: orange;">fallacy</a></span> of this idea. The phrenological
               combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard
               against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well
               is
               excited simultaneously with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well
               must
               be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification
               of
               combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: violet;">perverseness</a></span>, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly
               <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">antagonistical sentiment</a></span> exists.</p>
            <p>An <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: violet;">appeal to one's own heart</a></span> is, after all, the best
               reply to the sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
               questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the
               propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives
               no
               man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">earnest desire</a></span> to tantalize a listener by
               circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to
               please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">most laconic
                     and luminous language</a></span> is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only
               with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates
               the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain
               involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.
               The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">uncontrollable longing</a></span>, and the longing (to the deep regret
               and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.</p>
            <p>We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be
               ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued,
               for
               immediate energy and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the
               work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">souls are on fire.</a></span> It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it
               off until to-morrow, and why? There is no answer, except that we feel <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: violet;">perverse</a></span>, using the word with no comprehension of the
               principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty,
               but
               with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful,
               because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: blue;">moments fly.</a></span> The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble
               with the violence of the conflict within us, -- of the definite with the indefinite
               --
               of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it
               is the
               <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">shadow which prevails</a></span>, -- <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">we
                     struggle in vain.</a></span> The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the
               same time, it is the chanticleer -- note to the ghost that has so long
               overawed us. It flies -- it disappears -- we are free. The old energy returns. We
               will
               labor now. Alas, it is too late! </p>
            <p><span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;">We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss
                     -- we grow sick and dizzy.</a></span> Our first impulse is to <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">shrink from the danger.</a></span> Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness
               and dizziness and horror become merged <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">in a cloud of
                     unnamable feeling.</a></span> By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes
               shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian
               Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into
               palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and
               yet
               it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;">which chills
                     the very marrow of our bones</a></span> with the fierceness of the delight of its horror.
               It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy
               of a fall from such a height. And this fall -- this <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">rushing
                     annihilation</a></span> -- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and
               loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which
               have
               ever presented themselves to our imagination -- for this very cause do we now the
               most
               vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore
               do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally
               impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates
               a
               Plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost;
               for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot.
               If
               there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;">prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are
                     destroyed.</a></span></p>
            <p>Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from
               the <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: violet;">spirit of the Perverse</a></span>. We perpetrate them because we
               feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle;
               and
               we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were
               it
               not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.</p>
            <p>I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question, that I may
               explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you something that shall have at
               least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting
               this cell of the condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have
               misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">fancied me
                     mad.</a></span> As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted
               victims of the <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: violet;">Imp of the Perverse.</a></span></p>
            <p>It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough
               deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means of the murder. I rejected
               a thousand schemes, because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At
               length, in reading some French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness
               that occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally
               poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habit of reading in
               bed.
               I knew, too, that his <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;">apartment was narrow and ill-ventilated.</a></span>
               But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need not describe the easy artifices
               by which I substituted, in his bed-room candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making
               for
               the one which I there found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and
               the
               Coroner's verdict was -- "Death by the visitation of God."</p>
            <p>Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea of
               detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal taper I had myself
               carefully disposed. I had left <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">no shadow of a clew</a></span> by
               which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the crime. It is
               inconceivable how rich a sentiment of <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">satisfaction arose in
                     my bosom</a></span> as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long period of
               time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded me more real delight
               than
               all the mere worldly advantages accruing from my sin. But there arrived at length
               an
               epoch, <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;">from which the pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely
                     perceptible gradations, into a haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because
                     it haunted. I could scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common
                     thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories,
                     of
                     the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an
                     opera.</a></span> Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or the
               opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually catch myself
               pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low undertone, the phrase, "I am
               safe."</p>
            <p>One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the act of
               murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of petulance, I remodelled
               them thus; "I am safe -- I am safe -- yes -- if I be not fool enough to make open
               confession!"</p>
            <p>No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">icy chill
                     creep to my heart.</a></span> I had had some experience in these fits of perversity,
               (whose nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well that
               in no
               instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now my own casual
               self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which
               I
               had been guilty, confronted me, <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: red;">as if the very ghost of him whom I
                     had murdered -- and beckoned me on to death.</a></span></p>
            <p>At first, I made an effort to shake off this <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: indigo;">nightmare of the
                     soul.</a></span>
               <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;">I walked vigorously -- faster -- still faster -- at length I ran. I
                     felt a maddening desire to shriek aloud.</a></span> Every succeeding wave of thought
               overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood that to think,
               in
               my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my pace. I bounded <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: indigo;">like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares.</a></span> At length, the populace took
               the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: indigo;">consummation of my
                     fate.</a></span>
               <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;"> Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have done it, but a rough
                     voice resounded in my ears -- a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder. I turned
                     --
                     I gasped for breath. For a moment I experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I
                     became blind, and deaf, and giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck
                     me with his broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from
                     my
                     soul.</a></span></p>
            <p><span><a href="fos.html" style="color: teal;">They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with
                     marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before
                     concluding the brief,</a></span>
               <span><a href="fos.html" style="color: green;">but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and
                     to hell.</a></span> Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial
               conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon. But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these
               chains, and am here! To-morrow I shall be fetterless! -- but where?</p>
