                  <p>THE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than
                     permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was
                     one
                     of those piles of  which
                     have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs.
                     Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We
                     established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments.
                     It lay in a remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered
                     and
                     antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with  trophies, together with an unusually great
                     number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. In these
                     paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very
                     many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary -- in
                     these
                     paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so
                     that I
                     bade  to close the heavy shutters of the room -- since it was already
                     night -- to light the  which
                     stood by the head of my bed -- and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains
                     of
                     black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that I might resign
                     myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures,
                     and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which
                     purported to criticise and describe them.<span class="alliteration">commingled gloom and grandeur</span><span class="alliteration">manifold and multiform armorial</span><span class="metaphor">tongues of a tall candelabrum</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Long -- long I read -- and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and gloriously the
                     hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The position of the candelabrum displeased
                     me,
                     and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet,
                     I
                     placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of the
                     numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had
                     hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid
                     light
                     a picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening
                     into
                     womanhood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did
                     this
                     was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained thus
                     shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them. It was an impulsive movement
                     to gain time for thought -- to make sure that my vision had not deceived me -- to
                     calm
                     and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments
                     I
                     again looked fixedly at the painting.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of
                     the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was
                     stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The portrait, I have already said, was that of a . It was a
                     mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner; much
                     in
                     the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom, and even the ends of
                     the
                     radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the
                     back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque.
                     As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it
                     could
                     have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance,
                     which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of all, could it have been
                     that
                     my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living
                     person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and
                     of
                     the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea -- must have prevented even its
                     momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an
                     hour
                     perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At
                     length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed.
                     I had
                     found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which,
                     at
                     first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep and reverent
                     awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep agitation
                     being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings
                     and
                     their histories. Turning to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there
                     read
                     the vague and quaint words which follow:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee. And evil
                     was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the . He,
                     passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art; she a maiden
                     of
                     rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; ; loving and cherishing all things;
                     hating only the Art which was her rival; dreading only the pallet and brushes and
                     other
                     untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus
                     a
                     terrible thing for this lady to hear the  speak of his desire to
                     pourtray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for
                     many
                     weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas
                     only
                     from overhead. But he, the , took glory in his work, which went on
                     from hour to hour, and from day to day. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody
                     man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell
                     so
                     ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who
                     pined
                     visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she
                     saw
                     that the  (who had high renown) took a fervid and burning pleasure
                     in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew
                     daily more dispirited and weak.  And he would no see that the tints
                     which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside
                     him.
                     . And then the
                     brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the
                      stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in
                     the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying
                     with a loud voice,  turned suddenly to
                     regard his beloved: -- She was dead!<span class="simile">all light and
                        smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn</span><span class="irony">And in sooth some who beheld the
                        portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof
                        not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom
                        he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its
                        conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter
                        had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from canvas merely,
                        even to regard the countenance of his wife.</span><span class="simile">And when many weeks bad passed, and but little remained to do,
                        save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady
