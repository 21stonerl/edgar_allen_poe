               <p>
                  <p>THE symposium of the preceding evening had been a little too much for my nerves. I
                     had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy. Instead of going out therefore
                     to spend
                     the evening as I had proposed, it occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing
                     than just
                     eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>A light supper of course. I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit. More than a pound
                     at
                     once, however, may not at all times be advisable. Still, there can be no material
                     objection
                     to two. And really between two and three, there is merely a single unit of difference.
                     I
                     ventured, perhaps, upon four. My wife will have it five; -- but, clearly, she has
                     confounded
                     two very distinct affairs. The abstract number, five, I am willing to admit; but,
                     concretely, it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout, without which, in the way
                     of
                     condiment, Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p><span class="metaphor">Having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the serene hope
                        of
                        enjoying it till noon the next day, I placed my head upon the pillow, and, through
                        the aid
                        of a capital conscience, fell into a profound slumber forthwith.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I could not have completed my third
                     snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell, and then an impatient
                     thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once. In a minute afterward, and while
                     I was
                     still rubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, Doctor
                     . It ran thus:<span class="personification">But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? <span class="personification"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>By the time I had reached the "," it struck me that I was as wide awake as a
                     man need be. I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing all in my way; dressed
                     myself
                     with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the
                     .</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>There I found a very eager company assembled.  the  was extended upon the dining-table; and the moment I entered its
                     examination was commenced.<span class="personification">They had been awaiting me with much
                        impatience;<span class="personification"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by ,
                     a cousin of  from a tomb near Eleithias, in the Lybian mountains, a considerable
                     distance above Thebes on the Nile. The grottoes at this point, although less magnificent
                     than the Theban sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous
                     illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians. The chamber from which our specimen
                     was
                     taken, was said to be very rich in such illustrations; the walls being completely
                     covered
                     with fresco paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and Mosaic work of rich
                     patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same condition in
                     whichhad found it; -- that is to say, the coffin had not been disturbed.
                     For eight years it had thus stood, subject only externally to public inspection. We
                     had now,
                     therefore, the complete  at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely
                     the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once that we had
                     great
                     reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Approaching the table, I saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet long, and
                     perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. It was oblong -- not coffin-shaped.
                     The material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore (platanus), but,
                     upon
                     cutting into it, we found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, papier mache, composed
                     of
                     papyrus. It was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing funeral scenes, and
                     other
                     mournful subjects -- interspersed among which, in every variety of position, were
                     certain
                     series of hieroglyphical chars, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed.
                     By
                     good luck,  formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in translating the
                     letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the word .</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but having at length
                     accomplished the task, we came to a second, coffin-shaped, and very considerably less
                     in
                     size than the exterior one, but resembling it precisely in every other respect. The
                     interval
                     between the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the colors
                     of the
                     interior box.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a third case,
                     also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no particular, except in that
                     of its
                     material, which was cedar, and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor
                     of that
                     wood. Between the second and the third case there was no interval -- the one fitting
                     accurately within the other.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. We had expected
                     to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in
                     place of
                     these, we found a sort of sheath, made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster,
                     thickly gilt and painted. The paintings represented subjects connected with the various
                     supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities, with numerous
                     identical human figures, intended, very probably, as portraits of the persons embalmed.
                     Extending from head to foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic
                     hieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his
                     relations.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads, diverse
                     in
                     color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the scarabaeus, etc, with
                     the winged
                     globe. Around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation, with no
                     perceptible odor. The color was reddish. <span class="imagery">The skin was hard, smooth, and glossy. The teeth
                        and hair were in good condition. The eyes (it seemed) had been removed, and glass
                        ones
                        substituted, which were very beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception
                        of
                        somewhat too determined a stare. The fingers and the nails were brilliantly
                        gilded.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the embalmment
                     had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the surface with a steel
                     instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained, the flavor
                     of
                     camphor and other sweet-scented gums became apparent.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the
                     entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none. No member of
                     the party
                     was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met.
                     The brain
                     it was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an incision
                     in the
                     side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks,
                     when
                     the operation of embalming, properly so called, began.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>As no trace of an opening could be found,  was preparing his
                     instruments for dissection, when I observed that it was then past two o'clock. Hereupon
                     it
                     was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening; and we were
                     about to
                     separate for the present, when some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic
                     pile.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> About one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the
                      study, and conveyed thither the Egyptian.<span class="metaphor">The application of electricity to a  mummy three or four thousand years old at the
                        least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original, and we all caught
                        it at
                        once.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the
                     temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame,
                     but
                     which, as we had anticipated, of course, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility
                     when
                     brought in contact with the wire.  My
                     brief glance, in fact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed
                     to
                     be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now
                     so far
                     covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea remained
                     visible.<span class="imagery">This, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with
                        a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night, when my
                        eyes,
                        happening to fall upon those of the  Mummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>With a shout I called attention to the fact, and it became immediately obvious to
                     all.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon, because "alarmed" is, in my case,
                     not exactly the word. It is possible, however, that, but for the Brown Stout, I might
                     have
                     been a little nervous. As for the rest of the company, they really made no attempt
                     at
                     concealing the downright fright which possessed them.  was a man to be
                     pitied. , by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. , I fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his way, upon all
                     fours, under the table.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>After the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter of course,
                     upon further experiment forthwith. Our operations were now directed against the great
                     toe of
                     the right foot. We made an incision over the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum
                     pollicis
                     pedis, and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle. <span class="simile">Readjusting the battery, we now
                        applied the fluid to the bisected nerves -- when, with a movement of exceeding
                        life-likeness, the  Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in
                        contact
                        with the abdomen, and then, straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed
                        a kick
                        upon Doctor Ponnonner, which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an
                        arrow
                        from a catapult, through a window into the street below.<span class="simile"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p><span class="hyperbole">We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the
                        happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry, brimful
                        of
                        the most ardent philosophy, and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting
                        our experiment with vigor and with zeal.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound incision
                     into the tip of the subject's nose, while the  himself, laying violent hands upon it,
                     pulled it into vehement contact with the wire.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>:<span class="personification">Morally and physically -- figuratively and literally -- was the effect electric. In
                        the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes,
                        as
                        does Mr. Barnes in the pantomime, in the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it
                        sat upon
                        end; in the fourth, it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner's face; in the fifth, turning
                        to
                        Messieurs  Gliddon and  Buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital Egyptian,
                        thus</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I must say, gentlemen, that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at your
                     behaviour. Of  nothing better was to be expected. He is a poor little fat
                     fool who knows no better. I pity and forgive him. But you, - and you, Silk -- who
                     have travelled and resided in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born
                     -- you, I
                     say who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well, I think,
                     as you
                     write your mother tongue -- you, whom I have always been led to regard as the firm
                     friend of
                     the mummies -- I really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. What am
                     I to think
                     of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? What am I to suppose
                     by
                     your permitting Tom, Dick, and Harry to strip me of my coffins, and my clothes, in
                     this
                     wretchedly cold climate? In what light (to come to the point) am I to regard your
                     aiding and
                     abetting that miserable little villain, , in pulling me by the
                     nose?"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech under the
                     circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into violent hysterics, or
                     went off
                     in a general swoon. One of these three things was, I say, to be expected. Indeed each
                     and
                     all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. And, upon my
                     word, I
                     am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other.
                     Or, perhaps, after all, it was only the 
                     exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible.
                     However this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party betrayed any
                     very
                     particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially
                     wrong.<span class="metaphor">But,
                        perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age, which proceeds
                        by the
                        rule of contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as the solution of every
                        thing in
                        the way of paradox and impossibility. </span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>For my part I was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside, out of the
                     range of the Egyptian's fist.  thrust his hands into his breeches' pockets,
                     looked hard at the , and grew excessively red in the face. Mr. Glidden stroked his
                     whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt.  hung down his head, and put his
                     right thumb into the left corner of his mouth.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and at length,
                     with a sneer, said:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Why don't you speak, ? Did you hear what I asked you, or not? Do take
                     your thumb out of your mouth!"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of the left
                     corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the
                     right
                     corner of the aperture above-mentioned.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Not being able to get an answer from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly to,and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the deficiency of
                     American printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would afford me much pleasure
                     to record
                     here, in the original, the whole of his very excellent speech.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent conversation in
                     which the  took a part, was carried on in primitive Egyptian, through the medium (so
                     far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company) -- through the
                     medium,
                     I say, of Messieurs and , as interpreters.Just in the same way  failed to convey the absolutely
                     modern idea "wig," until (at  suggestion) he grew very pale in the face,
                     and consented to take off his own.<span class="hyperbole"> These gentlemen spoke the
                        mother tongue of the  Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but I could not help
                        observing
                        that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modern, and, of course,
                        entirely novel to the stranger) the two  travellers were reduced, occasionally, to
                        the
                        employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning.  Mr.
                        Gliddon,
                        at one period, for example, could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term "politics,"
                        until he sketched upon the wall, with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman,
                        out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown
                        forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward Heaven, and the mouth open
                        at an
                        angle of ninety degrees. </span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It will be readily understood that 's discourse turned chiefly upon the
                     vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies;
                     apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance that might have been occasioned
                     him, in
                     particular, the individual  called ; and concluding with a mere hint (for
                     it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were now explained,
                     it
                     might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended. Here  made
                     ready his instruments.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that  had
                     certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which I did not distinctly learn; but
                     he
                     expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered, and, getting down from the
                     table,
                     shook hands with the company all round.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>When this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in repairing the
                     damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. We sewed up the wound in
                     his
                     temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square inch of black plaster to the tip of
                     his
                     nose.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It was now observed that the Count (this was the title, it seems, of )
                     had a slight fit of shivering -- no doubt from the cold. The  immediately repaired to
                     his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black dress coat, made in Jennings' best manner,
                     a
                     pair of sky-blue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest
                     of
                     brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim,
                     patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of whiskers,
                     and a
                     waterfall cravat. Owing to the disparity of size between the Count and the  (the
                     proportion being as two to one), there was some little difficulty in adjusting these
                     habiliments upon the person of the Egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have
                     been
                     said to be dressed. , therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a comfortable
                     chair by the fire, while the  rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of
                     cigars and wine.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The conversation soon grew animated. Much curiosity was, of course, expressed in
                     regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of  still remaining alive.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I should have thought," observed , "that it is high time you were
                     dead."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Why," replied the Count, very much astonished, "I am little more than seven hundred
                     years old! My father lived a thousand, and was by no means in his dotage when he
                     died."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of which it became
                     evident that the antiquity of the  had been grossly misjudged. It had been five
                     thousand and fifty years and some months since he had been consigned to the catacombs
                     at
                     Eleithias.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"But my remark," resumed , "had no reference to your age at the period
                     of interment (I am willing to grant, in fact, that you are still a young man), and
                     my
                     illusion was to the immensity of time during which, by your own showing, you must
                     have been
                     done up in asphaltum."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"In what?" said the Count.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"In asphaltum," persisted.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Ah, yes; I have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to answer, no
                     doubt -- but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else than the Bichloride of
                     Mercury."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"But what we are especially at a loss to understand," said , "is how
                     it happens that, having been dead and buried in Egypt five thousand years ago, you
                     are here
                     to-day all alive and looking so delightfully well."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Had I been, as you say, dead," replied the Count, "it is more than probable that
                     dead, I should still be; for I perceive you are yet in the infancy of Calvanism, and
                     cannot
                     accomplish with it what was a common thing among us in the old days. But the fact
                     is, I fell
                     into catalepsy, and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or
                     should
                     be; they accordingly embalmed me at once -- I presume you are aware of the chief principle
                     of the embalming process?"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Why not altogether."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Why, I perceive -- a deplorable condition of ignorance! Well I cannot enter into
                     details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm (properly speaking),
                     in
                     Egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process.
                     I use
                     the word 'animal' in its widest sense, as including the physical not more than the
                     moral and
                     vital being. I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us,
                     in the
                     immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions
                     subjected
                     to the process. To be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period
                     of
                     embalmment, in that condition he remained. Now, as it is my good fortune to be of
                     the blood
                     of the Scarabaeus, I was embalmed alive, as you see me at present."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"The blood of the Scarabaeus!" exclaimed .</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Yes. The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the 'arms,' of a very distinguished and
                     very rare patrician family. To be 'of the blood of the Scarabaeus,' is merely to be
                     one of
                     that family of which the Scarabaeus is the insignium. I speak figuratively."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"But what has this to do with you being alive?"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Why, it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse, before embalmment, of
                     its bowels and brains; the race of the Scarabaei alone did not coincide with the custom.
                     Had
                     I not been a Scarabeus, therefore, I should have been without bowels and brains; and
                     without
                     either it is inconvenient to live."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I perceive that," said , "and I presume that all the entire mummies
                     that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Beyond doubt."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I thought," said , very meekly, "that the Scarabaeus was one of the
                     Egyptian gods."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"One of the Egyptian what?" exclaimed the , starting to its feet.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Gods!" repeated the .</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>", I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style," said the Count,
                     resuming his chair. "No nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged more
                     than
                     one god. The Scarabaeus, the Ibis, etc., were with us (as similar creatures have been
                     with
                     others) the symbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the Creator too
                     august to
                     be more directly approached."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>There was here a pause. At length the colloquy was renewed by.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"It is not improbable, then, from what you have explained," said he, "that among the
                     catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the Scarabaeus tribe, in
                     a
                     condition of vitality?"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"There can be no question of it," replied the Count; "all the Scarabaei embalmed
                     accidentally while alive, are alive now. Even some of those purposely so embalmed,
                     may have
                     been overlooked by their executors, and still remain in the tomb."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Will you be kind enough to explain," I said, "what you mean by 'purposely so
                     embalmed'?"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"With great pleasure!" answered the , after surveying me leisurely through his
                     eye-glass -- for it was the first time I had ventured to address him a direct
                     question.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"With great pleasure," he said.  Few men died, unless by most extraordinary accident, before the
                     age of six hundred; few lived longer than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered
                     the natural term. After the discovery of the embalming principle, as I have already
                     described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might
                     be
                     gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of science much advanced, by living
                     this
                     natural term in installments. In the case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated
                     that
                     something of this kind was indispensable. An historian, for example, having attained
                     the age
                     of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully
                     embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that they should cause him
                     to be
                     revivified after the lapse of a certain period -- say five or six hundred years. These guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or
                     emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed
                     the
                     text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book. When
                     discovered, it was never worth the trouble of the search. After re-writing it throughout,
                     it
                     was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately
                     in
                     correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the traditions of the day
                     concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived. Now this process of re-scription
                     and
                     personal rectification, pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had
                     the
                     effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable."<span class="hyperbole">"The usual duration of man's life, in my time, was
                        about eight hundred years.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span><span class="metaphor"> Resuming

                        into a species of hap-hazard note-book -- that is to say, into a kind of literary
                        arena for
                        the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated

                  <p>"I beg your pardon," said  at this point, laying his hand gently upon
                     the arm of the Egyptian -- "I beg your pardon, sir, but may I presume to interrupt
                     you for
                     one moment?"</p>

               <p>
                  <p>"By all means, sir," replied the Count, drawing up.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I merely wished to ask you a question," said the . "You mentioned the
                     historian's personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch. Pray, sir,
                     upon an
                     average what proportion of these Kabbala were usually found to be right?"</p>

               <p>
                  <p>"The Kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to be
                     precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written histories themselves;
                     --
                     that is to say, not one individual iota of either was ever known, under any circumstances,
                     to be not totally and radically wrong."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"But since it is quite clear," resumed the , "that at least five thousand years
                     have elapsed since your entombment, I take it for granted that your histories at that
                     period, if not your traditions were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal
                     interest, the Creation, which took place, as I presume you are aware, only about ten
                     centuries before."</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <p>The  repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional explanation
                     that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. The latter at length said,
                     hesitatingly:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"The ideas you have suggested are to me, I confess, utterly novel. During my time
                     I
                     never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe (or this
                     world if
                     you will have it so) ever had a beginning at all. I remember once, and once only,
                     hearing
                     something remotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin of
                     the human
                     race; and by this individual, the very word Adam (or Red Earth), which you make use
                     of, was
                     employed."<span class="metaphor"> He employed it, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous
                        germination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are
                        germinated) -- the spontaneous germination, I say, of five vast hordes of men,
                        simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the
                        globe.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of us touched
                     our foreheads with a very significant air. , first glancing slightly at
                     the occiput and then at the sinciput of , spoke as follows:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"The long duration of human life in your time, together with the occasional practice
                     of passing it, as you have explained, in installments, must have had, indeed, a strong
                     tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge. I presume, therefore,
                     that we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars
                     of
                     science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the Yankees, altogether
                     to
                     the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I confess again," replied the Count, with much suavity, "that I am somewhat at a
                     loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science do you allude?"</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the assumptions of
                     phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Having heard us to an end, the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes, which
                     rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had flourished and faded
                     in Egypt
                     so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were
                     really
                     very contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban
                     savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. He smiled
                     rather contemptuously, and said they were.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>This put me a little out, but I began to make other inquiries in regard to his
                     astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as yet opened
                     his mouth,
                     whispered in my ear, that for information on this head, I had better consult Ptolemy
                     (whoever Ptolemy is), as well as one Plutarch de facie lunae.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I then questioned the  about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in general, about
                     the manufacture of glass; but I had not made an end of my queries before the silent
                     member
                     again touched me quietly on the elbow, and begged me for God's sake to take a peep
                     at
                     Diodorus Siculus. As for the Count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we
                     moderns
                     possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of the
                     Egyptians. While I was thinking how I should answer this question, little 
                     committed himself in a very extraordinary way.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Look at our architecture!" he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of both the
                     , who pinched him black and blue to no purpose.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Look," he cried with enthusiasm, "at the Bowling-Green Fountain in New York! or if
                     this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the Capitol at Washington, D.
                     C.!" --
                     and the good little medical man went on to detail very minutely, the proportions of
                     the
                     fabric to which he referred. He explained that the portico alone was adorned with
                     no less
                     than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that moment,
                     the
                     precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of Aznac, whose
                     foundations were laid in the night of Time, but the ruins of which were still standing,
                     at
                     the epoch of his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes. He
                     recollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior
                     palace in
                     a kind of suburb called Carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven
                     feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart. The palace itself (as well as he could
                     remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been altogether about
                     seven
                     in circuit. Its walls were richly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics.
                     He would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the   That palace at Carnac was an
                     insignificant little building after all. He (the Count), however, could not conscientiously
                     refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and superiority of the Fountain at the
                     Bowling
                     Green, as described by the . Nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been
                     seen in Egypt or elsewhere.<span class="hyperbole"> The approach to this portico, from the
                        Nile, was through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks,
                        twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span><span class="hyperbole">Capitols might have
                        been built within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred
                        of them
                        might not have been squeezed in with some trouble.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Nothing," he replied, "in particular." They were rather slight, rather
                     ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. They could not be compared, of course, with
                     the
                     vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which the Egyptians conveyed entire
                     temples
                     and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>He agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how I should have gone
                     to
                     work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at
                     Carnac.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>This question I concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of Artesian
                     wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while  winked at me very hard and said,
                     in a low tone, that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to
                     bore for
                     water in the Great Oasis.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked me if our
                     steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks, and which was
                     wrought
                     altogether by edge-tools of copper.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to
                     Metaphysics. We sent for a copy of a book called the "Dial," and read out of it a
                     chapter or
                     two about something that is not very clear, but which the Bostonians call the Great
                     Movement
                     of Progress.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in his day,
                     and
                     as for Progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it never progressed.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy, and were at much
                     trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living
                     where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king.</p>

               <p>
                  <p>He listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused. When we
                     had
                     done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred something of a very similar
                     sort.
                     Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent
                     example to the rest of mankind. They assembled their wise men, and concocted the most
                     ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. For a while they managed remarkably
                     well;
                     only their habit of bragging was prodigious. The thing ended, however, in the consolidation
                     of the thirteen states, with some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and
                     insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>As well as the Count could recollect, it was Mob.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Not knowing what to say to this, I raised my voice, and deplored the Egyptian
                     ignorance of steam.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The Count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. .<span class="metaphor">The silent
                        gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows -- told me
                        I had
                        sufficiently exposed myself for once -- and demanded if I was really such a fool as
                        not to
                        know that the modern steam-engine is derived from the invention of Hero, through Solomon
                        de
                        Caus<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck would have
                     it,
                     , having rallied, returned to our rescue, and inquired if the people of
                     Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the all- important particular
                     of
                     dress.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The Count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and then taking
                     hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some minutes.
                     Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear;
                     but I do
                     not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the , approaching the  with great
                     dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a gentleman, if the Egyptians
                     had
                     comprehended, at any period, the manufacture of either  lozenges or Brandreth's
                     pills.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>We looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer -- but in vain. It was not
                     forthcoming. The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head. Never was triumph more consummate;
                     never was defeat borne with so ill a grace. Indeed, I could not endure the spectacle
                     of the
                     poor  mortification. I reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took
                     leave.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Upon getting home I found it past four o'clock, and went immediately to bed. It is
                     now ten A.M. I have been up since seven, penning these memoranda for the benefit of
                     my
                     family and of mankind. The former I shall behold no more. My wife is a shrew. The
                     truth is,
                     I am heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. I am convinced
                     that every thing is going wrong. Besides, I am anxious to know who will be President
                     in
                     2045. As soon, therefore, as I shave and swallow a cup of coffee, I shall just step
                     over to
                      and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years.</p>
