            <div class="biography">
                <p>Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic, best known for his tales of macabre, mystery, and horror. His works, including iconic short stories such as The Tell-Tale Heart, The Fall of the House of Usher, and The Cask of Amontillado, along with the haunting poem The Raven, have cemented his reputation as one of the most influential figures in American literature.</p>
                
                <h2>Early Life and Tragedy</h2>
                <p>Poe was born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Massachusetts, to actors David and Elizabeth Poe. His father abandoned the family when Poe was just a baby, and his mother died of tuberculosis when he was only two years old. Orphaned at a young age, he was taken in by John and Frances Allan, wealthy merchants in Richmond, Virginia, although they never formally adopted him. His relationship with John Allan was strained throughout his life, which would become a source of personal turmoil.</p>
                
                <p>Poe attended the University of Virginia for a short time, but due to financial struggles and disputes with his foster father, he left and joined the U.S. Army in 1827. He later enrolled at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, but his time there was brief as he was dismissed after a series of conflicts with authority.</p>
                
                <h2>Struggles and Writing Career</h2>
                <p>After leaving West Point, Poe turned to writing, and his first book, Tamerlane and Other Poems, was published anonymously in 1827. Though it went largely unnoticed, it marked the beginning of his writing career. He later worked as a journalist and editor for several literary journals, but his career was marked by financial instability and personal struggles, including battles with alcoholism and depression.</p>
                
                <p>Poe gained significant recognition for his short stories, which often focused on themes of death, madness, guilt, and the supernatural. His stories combined psychological depth with dark, gothic atmospheres, exploring the fragility of the human mind. Poe was also a pioneer in the detective genre with his creation of the character C. Auguste Dupin in The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841), often considered the first modern detective story.</p>
                
                <p>Though his work earned him some success, Poe’s life was marred by tragedy and hardship. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, who would die from tuberculosis in 1847, a loss that deeply affected Poe and intensified his struggle with mental illness and alcoholism.</p>
                
                <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
                <p>Poe’s life came to a tragic end on October 7, 1849, when he was found delirious and in a state of disarray on the streets of Baltimore. He died a few days later at the age of 40, under mysterious circumstances. The exact cause of his death remains unknown, with theories ranging from alcohol poisoning to a brain lesion or even rabies.</p>
                
                <p>Despite his early death, Poe’s work left an indelible mark on literature. His innovative use of psychological horror, unreliable narrators, and the exploration of the human psyche helped define modern horror and detective fiction. His influence can be seen in the works of writers like Arthur Conan Doyle, H.P. Lovecraft, and Stephen King, among others.</p>
                
                <p>Poe’s poetry and stories continue to captivate readers around the world, and his legacy as a master of dark and gothic literature remains unchallenged. Today, he is regarded as one of the foundational figures of American literature, whose contributions to the short story form, as well as his distinctive poetic style, have shaped the course of literary history.</p>
