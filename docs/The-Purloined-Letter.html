               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--, I was enjoying
                     the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend , in his little back library, or
                     book-closet, au troisieme, No. 33, Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at
                     least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might
                     have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that
                     oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing
                     certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period
                     of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the
                     murder of . I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a
                     coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old
                     acquaintance, , the Prefect of the Parisian police. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the
                     entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several
                     years. We had been sitting in the dark, and  now arose for the purpose
                     of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon â€™s saying
                     that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about
                     some
                     official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     
                     observed , as he forbore to enkindle the wick, 
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     
                     said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling every thing "odd" that was beyond his
                     comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of "oddities." </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                      said , as he
                     supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable chair. </p>

               <p>

                      replied
                     , as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled
                     himself in his chair.

                     and
                     struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the
                     house, without having uttered a syllable since  had requested him to
