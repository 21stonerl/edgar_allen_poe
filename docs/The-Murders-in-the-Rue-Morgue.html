                  <p>THE mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves, but little
                     susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their effects. We know of them,
                     among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately
                     possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical
                     ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories
                     the
                     analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. He derives pleasure from even the
                     most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is fond of enigmas, of
                     conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen
                     which appears to the ordinary apprehension pr√¶ternatural. His results, brought about
                     by
                     the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth,<span class="metaphor"> the whole air
                        of intuition.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and
                     especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of
                     its
                     retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate
                     is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort
                     at
                     the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character,
                     is
                     greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat
                     peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion
                     to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and
                     more
                     usefully tasked by the  In this latter, where the pieces have
                     different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex
                     is
                     mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called
                     powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting
                     in
                     injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances
                     of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more
                     concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the
                     contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities
                     of
                     inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed,
                     what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be
                     less
                     abstract --Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four
                     kings,
                     and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the
                     victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherche movement,
                     the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources,
                     the
                     analyst ,
                     identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole
                     methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error
                     or
                     hurry into miscalculation.<span class="simile">unostentatious game of draughts than by all

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating
                     power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently
                     unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there
                     is
                     nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best
                     chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but
                     proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important
                     undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that
                     perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence
                     legitimate advantage may be derived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and
                     lie
                     frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary
                     understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the
                     concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle
                     (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally
                     comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive memory, and to proceed by  are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing. But it
                     is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced.
                     He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his
                     companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not
                     so
                     much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The
                     necessary knowledge is that of what to observe. Our player confines himself not at
                     all;
                     nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external
                     to
                     the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with
                     that
                     of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand;
                     often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by
                     their
                     holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering
                     a
                     fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise,
                     of
                     triumph, or of chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether
                     the
                     person taking it can make another in the suit. He recognises what is played through
                     feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent
                     word;
                     the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or
                     carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order
                     of
                     their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation --all afford,
                     to
                     his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The
                     first
                     two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of
                     each
                     hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards <span class="simile">with as absolute a
                        precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of
                        their own.<span class="simile"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the
                     analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable
                     of
                     analysis. The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested,
                     and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ,
                     supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect
                     bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers
                     on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far
                     greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character
                     very strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always
                     fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.</p>

                  <p>The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a
                     commentary upon the propositions just advanced.</p>

               <p>
                  <p>Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18--, I there became
                     acquainted with a . This young gentleman was of an
                     excellent -- indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events,
                     had
                     been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it,
                     and
                     he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes.
                     By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant
                     of
                     his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a
                     rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about
                     its superfluities. Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily
                     obtained.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the
                     accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume,
                     brought us into closer communion. We saw each other again and again. I was deeply
                     interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor
                     which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme. I was astonished, too,
                     at
                     the vast extent of his reading; and, above all,, and the vivid freshness of his
                     imagination. Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought,; and
                     this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live
                     together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat
                     less
                     embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and
                     furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper long deserted
                     through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in
                     a
                     retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.<span class="metaphor"> I felt my soul
                        enkindled within me by the wild fervor<span class="metaphor"></span></span><span class="metaphor"> I felt
                        that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price<span class="metaphor"></span></span><span class="personification"> a time-eaten and grotesque mansion,<span class="personification"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have
                     been regarded as madmen --although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature. Our
                     seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors. Indeed the locality of our retirement
                     had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many
                     years since  had ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed
                     within ourselves alone.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>; and into this
                     bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims
                     with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always;
                     but
                     we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all
                     the
                     messy shutters of our old building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly
                     perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these
                     we
                     then busied our souls in dreams --reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by
                     the
                     clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied forth into the streets,
                     arm in
                     arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour,
                     seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental
                     excitement which quiet observation can afford.<span class="alliteration">It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall
                        I call it?) to be enamored of the Night for her own sake<span class="alliteration"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich
                     ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in
                     . He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise --if
                     not exactly in its display --and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived.
                     He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, and was wont to follow up such
                     assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own.
                     His
                     manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression;
                     while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded
                     petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation.
                     Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of
                     the
                     Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double  --the
                     creative and the resolvent.<span class="metaphor"> wore windows in their bosoms,<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any
                     mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman, was merely
                     the
                     result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased intelligence. But of the character
                     of his
                     remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the
                     Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken
                     a
                     syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once  broke forth with
                     these words:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in
                     reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my
                     meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was
                     profound.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said I,
                     gravely,  Here I paused, to
                     ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>___  said
                     he, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.
                      was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming
                     stage-mad, had attempted the r√¥le of Xerxes, in Cr√©billon's tragedy so called, and
                     been
                     notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I
                     exclaimed,  In
                     fact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> replied my
                     friend, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket
                     of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C___
                     into
                     the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with  I
                     could not possibly understand.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>There was not a particle of charlatanerie about .  he said, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused
                     themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds
                     have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts
                     it for
                     the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence
                     between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement when
                     I
                     heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help
                     acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue
                     C___. This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a
                     fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you
                     upon
                     a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair.
                     You
                     stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared
                     vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded
                     in
                     silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become
                     with me, of late, a species of necessity.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"You kept your eyes upon the ground --glancing, with a petulant expression, at the
                     holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones,)
                     until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of
                     experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened
                     up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word
                     'stereotomy,' a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew that
                     you could not say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies,
                     and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not
                     very
                     long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague
                     guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony,
                     I
                     felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion,
                     and
                     I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured
                     that I
                     had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon
                     , which appeared in yesterday's 'Mus√©e,' the satirist, making some
                     disgraceful allusions to the cobbler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted
                     a
                     Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and,
                     from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could
                     not
                     have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the
                     two
                     ideas of Orion and . That you did combine them I saw by the
                     character of the smile which passed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler's
                     immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself
                     up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure
                     of
                     . At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that
                     as, in fact, he was a very little fellow --that  --he would do
                     better at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s."</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the
                      when the following paragraphs arrested our
                     attention.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS. --This morning, about three o'clock, the inhabitants of
                     the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks,
                     issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to
                     be in
                     the sole occupancy of one , and her daughter,
                     . After some delay, occasioned by a
                     fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken
                     in
                     with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two gendarmes.
                     By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of
                     stairs, two or more rough voices, in angry contention, were distinguished, and seemed
                     to
                     proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second landing was reached, these
                     sounds, also, had ceased, and everything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread
                     themselves, and hurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in
                     the
                     fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced
                     open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror
                     than with astonishment.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"The apartment was in the wildest disorder --the furniture broken and thrown about
                     in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed,
                     and thrown into the middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood.
                     On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled
                     in blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found
                     four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of
                     m√©tal
                     d'Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers
                     of a
                     bureau, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although
                     many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed
                     (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no
                     contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Of  no traces were here seen; but an unusual
                     quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the chimney,
                     and
                     (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom;
                     it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance. The
                     body
                     was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned
                     by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were
                     many
                     severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger
                     nails,<span class="metaphor"> as if the deceased had been throttled to
                        death.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without farther
                     discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building,
                     where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an
                     attempt to raise her, the head fell off. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully
                     mutilated --the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The next day's paper had these additional particulars.</p>

                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, laundress, deposes that she has known both the
                     deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period. The old lady
                     and
                     her daughter seemed on good terms --very affectionate towards each other. They were
                     excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living. Believed
                     that
                     Madame L. told fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met
                     any
                     persons in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure that
                     they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the
                     building except in the fourth story.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of
                     selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to  for
                     nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided there. The
                     deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found,
                     for
                     more than six years. It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the upper
                     rooms to various persons. The house was the property of Madame L. She became
                     dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself,
                     refusing to let any portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter
                     some five or six times during the six years. The two lived an exceedingly retired
                     life
                     --were reputed to have money. Had heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L.
                     told
                     fortunes --did not believe it. Had never seen any person enter the door except the
                     old
                     lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten
                     times.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one was spoken
                     of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there were any living connexions
                     of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened.
                     Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth
                     story. The house was a good house --not very old.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house
                     about three o'clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the
                     gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet
                     --not
                     with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being
                     a
                     double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom nor top. The shrieks were continued
                     until the gate was forced --and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of
                     some
                     person (or persons) in great agony --were loud and drawn out, not short and quick.
                     Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in
                     loud
                     and angry contention --the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller --a very strange
                     voice. Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman.
                     Was
                     positive that it was not a woman's voice. Could distinguish the words 'sacr√©' and
                     'diable.' The shrill voice was that of a foreigner. Could not be sure whether it was
                     the
                     voice of a man or of a woman. Could not make out what was said, but believed the
                     language to be Spanish. The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this
                     witness as we described them yesterday.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that he
                     was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the testimony of Mus√®t
                     in
                     general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the
                     crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill
                     voice, this witness thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French.
                     Could
                     not be sure that it was a man's voice. It might have been a woman's. Was not acquainted
                     with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the
                     intonation that the speaker was an Italian. Knew Madame L. and her daughter. Had
                     conversed with both frequently. Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either
                     of
                     the deceased.</p>

                  <p>___ , restaurateur. This witness volunteered his testimony.
                     Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of Amsterdam.
                     Was
                     passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes --probably
                     ten. They were long and loud --very awful and distressing. Was one of those who entered
                     the building. Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure
                     that
                     the shrill voice was that of a man --of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the words
                     uttered. They were loud and quick --unequal --spoken apparently in fear as well as
                     in
                     anger. The voice was harsh --not so much shrill as harsh. Could not call it a shrill
                     voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly 'sacr√©,' 'diable,' and once 'mon Dieu.'</p>

                     Is the elder Mignaud.  had some property. Had opened an
                     account with his banking house in the spring of the year ---- (eight years previously).
                     Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for nothing until the third day
                     before
                     her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in
                     gold, and a clerk went home with the money.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in
                     question, about noon, he accompanied  to her residence
                     with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened, Mademoiselle
                     L.
                     appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him
                     of the
                     other. He then bowed and departed. Did not see any person in the street at the time.
                     It
                     is a bye-street --very lonely.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered
                     the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of the first to
                     ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a
                     Frenchman. Could make out several words, but cannot now remember all. Heard distinctly
                     'sacr√©' and 'mon Dieu.' There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons
                     struggling --a scraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud --louder
                     than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to
                     be
                     that of a German. Might have been a woman's voice. Does not understand German.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the door of the
                     chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when
                     the
                     party reached it. Every thing was perfectly silent --no groans or noises of any kind.
                     Upon forcing the door no person was seen. The windows, both of the back and front
                     room,
                     were down and firmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was closed,
                     but
                     not locked. The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked, with
                     the
                     key on the inside. A small room in the front of the house, on the fourth story, at
                     the
                     head of the passage, was open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old
                     beds,
                     boxes, and so forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not an inch
                     of
                     any portion of the house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and
                     down
                     the chimneys. The house was a four story one, with garrets (mansardes.) A trap-door
                     on
                     the roof was nailed down very securely --did not appear to have been opened for years.
                     The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking
                     open
                     of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made it as short as
                     three
                     minutes --some as long as five. The door was opened with difficulty.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue
                     Morgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the house. Did not
                     proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation.
                     Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could not
                     distinguish what was said. The shrill voice was that of an Englishman --is sure of
                     this.
                     Does not understand the English language, but judges by the intonation.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first to
                     ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that of a
                     Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared to be expostulating.
                     Could
                     not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the
                     voice of a Russian. Corroborates the general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed
                     with a native of Russia.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on
                     the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being. By 'sweeps'
                     were
                     meant cylindrical sweeping-brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys.
                     These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage
                     by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The body
                     of
                     Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got
                     down until four or five of the party united their strength.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies
                     about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber
                     where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and
                     excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account
                     for these appearances. The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches
                     just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the
                     impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the eye-balls protruded.
                     The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the
                     pit
                     of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of
                     M.
                     Dumas, Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons
                     unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of the right
                     leg
                     and arm were more or less shattered. The left tibia much splintered, as well as all
                     the
                     ribs of the left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible
                     to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of
                     iron
                     --a chair -- any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results,
                     if
                     wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows
                     with any weapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated
                     from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with
                     some very sharp instrument --probably with a razor.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the
                     bodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other persons were
                     examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never
                     before committed in Paris --if indeed a murder has been committed at all. The police
                     are
                     entirely at fault --an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not,
                     however, the shadow of a clew apparent.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still
                     continued in the Quartier St. Roch --that the premises in question had been carefully
                     re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose.
                     A
                     postscript, however, mentioned that  had been arrested and
                     imprisoned --although nothing appeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already
                     detailed.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair
                     --at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only after
                     the
                     announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting
                     the
                     murders.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery. I
                     saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     said , by this shell of an examination. The Parisian police, so much
                     extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings,
                     beyond the method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not
                     unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind
                     of
                     Monsieur Jourdain's calling for his robe-de-chambre --pour mieux entendre la musique.
                     The results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part,
                     are brought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing,
                     their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man.
                     But,
                     without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his
                     investigations. He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see,
                     perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily,
                     lost
                     sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound.
                      In fact, as regards the more
                     important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial.  and not upon
                     the mountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error
                     are
                     well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances
                     --to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the
                     retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to
                     behold
                     the star distinctly -- is to have the best appreciation of its lustre --a lustre which
                     grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it. A greater number
                     of
                     rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the
                     more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble
                     thought;<span class="metaphor">Truth is not always in a well.<span class="metaphor"></span></span><span class="metaphor">The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her,<span class="metaphor"></span></span><span class="metaphor"> and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish
                        from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too
                        direct.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue. This is
                     one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and
                     the
                     Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is
                     at a
                     great distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily found; for there
                     were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity,
                     from the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway,
                     on
                     one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating
                     a loge de concierge. Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley,
                     and
                     then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building --, meanwhile,
                     examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention
                     for which I could see no possible object.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having
                     shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge. We went up stairs --into
                     the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both
                     the
                     deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist.
                     I
                     saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the 
                      scrutinized every thing --not excepting the bodies of the victims. We
                     then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us
                     throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure. On
                     our
                     way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily
                     papers.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Je les m√©nagais:
                     --for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his humor, now, to decline
                     all
                     conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day. He then
                     asked
                     me, suddenly, if I had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word
                      which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> he replied,
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> continued he,
                     looking toward the door of our apartment --</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while
                      went on,
                     I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was addressed
                     to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is
                     commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. His eyes, regarded only the wall.<span class="simile"> very much as if in a soliloquy.<span class="simile"></span></span><span class="hyperbole"> vacant in expression,<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> he said, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be
                     that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one
                     individual termed it, the harsh voice.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said

               <p>
                  <p> continued
                     , "</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we first
                     seek here?  It
                     is not too much to say that neither of us believe in praeternatural events. Madame
                     and
                     Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were
                     material, and escaped materially. Then how? Fortunately, there is but one mode of
                     reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision. --Let
                     us
                     examine, each by each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins
                     were
                     in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining,
                     when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from these two apartments that
                     we
                     have to seek issues. The police have laid bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry
                     of the walls, in every direction. No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance.
                     But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then, no secret
                     issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with
                     the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys. These, although of ordinary width for
                     some
                     eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the
                     body
                     of a large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus
                     absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no one could
                     have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street. The murderers must have
                     passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to this conclusion in so
                     unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on
                     account of apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent
                     'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such.<span class="hyperbole">The means of egress employed by the murderers.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by furniture,
                     and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head
                     of
                     the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former was found securely
                     fastened from within. It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise
                     it.
                     A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail
                     was
                     found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining the other window, a similar
                     nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed
                     also. The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these
                     directions. And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw
                     the
                     nails and open the windows.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have
                     just given --because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be
                     proved to be not such in reality.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I proceeded to think thus --√† posteriori. The murderers did escape from one of
                     these windows. This being so, they could not have re-fastened the sashes from the
                     inside, as they were found fastened; --the consideration which put a stop, through
                     its
                     obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes were
                     fastened. They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape
                     from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with
                     some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I
                     had
                     anticipated. A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of
                     my
                     idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still
                     appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light
                     the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise
                     the sash.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through
                     this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught --but the nail
                     could not have been replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the
                     field
                     of my investigations. The assassins must have escaped through the other window.
                     Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there
                     must
                     be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture.
                     Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at
                     the
                     second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed
                     the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor.
                     I
                     now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the
                     same
                     manner --driven in nearly up to the head.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood
                     the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.'
                     The scent had never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the
                     chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result, --and that result was the nail.
                     It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window;
                     but
                     this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared
                     with
                     the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew. 'There must be
                     something wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.' I touched it; and the head, with about
                     a
                     quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was
                     in
                     the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its
                     edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow
                     of a
                     hammer, which had partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion
                     of
                     the nail. I now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had
                     taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete -- the fissure was
                     invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head
                     went
                     up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the
                     whole nail was again perfect.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through the window
                     which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps
                     purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention
                     of
                     this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail, --farther
                     inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had been
                     satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from
                     the
                     casement in question there runs a lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been
                     impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it.
                     I
                     observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind
                     called by Parisian carpenters ferrades --a kind rarely employed at the present day,
                     but
                     frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux. They are in the form
                     of
                     an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the lower half is latticed
                     or worked in open trellis  In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a
                     half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half
                     open
                     --that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that
                     the
                     police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking
                     at
                     these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not
                     perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due
                     consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have
                     been
                     made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination.
                     It
                     was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of
                     the
                     bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the
                     lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of
                     activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus
                     effected. --By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the
                     shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the
                     trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against
                     the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close
                     it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself
                     into
                     the room.<span class="metaphor">--thus affording an excellent hold for
                        the hands.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree
                     of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat. It is
                     my
                     design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished: --but,
                     secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary
                     --the almost preternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished
                     it.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that 'to make out my case,'
                     I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required
                     in this matter. This may be the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason.
                     My
                     ultimate object is only the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in
                     juxta-position, that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken, with that
                     very
                     peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons
                     could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be
                     detected.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of
                      flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of
                     comprehension, without power to comprehend --as men, at times, find themselves upon
                     the
                     brink of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. My friend went
                     on
                     with his discourse.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> he said,
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>"Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention
                     --that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive
                     in a
                     murder so singularly atrocious as this --let us glance at the butchery itself. Here
                     is a
                     woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward.
                     Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they thus
                     dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you
                     will
                     admit that there was something excessively outr√© --something altogether irreconcilable
                     with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most
                     depraved of men. Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have
                     thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons
                     was found barely sufficient to drag it down!</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous. On
                     the hearth were thick tresses --very thick tresses --of grey human hair. These had
                     been
                     torn out by the roots. You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus
                     from
                     the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well
                     as
                     myself. Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of
                     the
                     scalp --sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps
                     half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut,
                     but
                     the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish
                     you
                     also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of
                      I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy
                     coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse
                     instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was
                     clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the
                     window
                     which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the
                     police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them --because,
                     by
                     the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the
                     possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.</p>

                  <p>I felt a creeping of the flesh as  asked me the question.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> continued my
                     friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I made the attempt in vain.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> he said. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> replied

                  <p>It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous
                     Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength
                     and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia
                     are
                     sufficiently well known to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.</p>

                  <p>CAUGHT -- In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the ___ inst., (the
                     morning of the murder,) a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species.
                     The

                     from
                     its capture and keeping. Call at No. ___ , Rue ___, Faubourg St. Germain --au

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I asked,
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said ,
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The front door of the house had been left open, and the visiter had entered,
                     without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase. Now, however, he seemed
                     to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending.  was moving quickly to
                     the door, when we again heard him coming up. He did not turn back a second time, but
                     stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our chamber.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said ,
                     in a cheerful and hearty tone.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>A man entered. He was a sailor, evidently, --a tall, stout, and muscular-looking
                     person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether
                     unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker
                     and
                     mustachio. He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed.
                     He
                     bowed awkwardly, and bade us  in French accents, which,
                     although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian
                     origin.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said
                     . </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The  drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of
                     some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     said .</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said the man. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> replied my friend,
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just
                     as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket.
                     He
                     then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the
                     table.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation. He
                     started to his feet and grasped his cudgel; but the next moment he fell back into
                     his
                     seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself. He spoke not
                     a
                     word. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said
                     , in a kind tone, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, while  uttered these words; but his original
                     boldness of bearing was all gone.<span class="metaphor"> in a great
                        measure,<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said he, after a
                     brief pause, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage to the Indian
                     Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the
                     interior on an excursion of pleasure. Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-
                     Outang. This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After
                     great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home
                     voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris,
                     where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he
                     kept
                     it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot,
                     received from a splinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell it.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Returning home from some sailors' frolic the night, or rather in the morning of
                     the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room, into which it had broken
                     from
                     a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in
                     hand,
                     and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation
                     of
                     shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole
                     of
                     the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an
                     animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at
                     a
                     loss what to do. He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its
                     fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it,
                     the
                     Ourang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and
                     thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally
                     stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until the latter had nearly
                     come
                     up with it. It then again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long
                     time.
                     The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning.
                     In
                     passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was
                     arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of 's
                     chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it perceived the
                     lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which
                     was
                     thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon
                     the
                     headboard of the bed. The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked
                     open again by the Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes
                     of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which
                     it
                     had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down. On
                     the
                     other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house.
                     This
                     latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning-rod is
                     ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high
                     as
                     the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could
                     accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room.
                     At
                     this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that
                     those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates
                     of the Rue Morgue.  and her daughter, habited in their
                     night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest
                     already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open,
                     and
                     its contents lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their
                     backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast
                     and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived. The
                     flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized  by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing it,) and
                     was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber.
                     The
                     daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned. The screams and struggles
                     of the
                     old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing
                     the
                     probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined
                     sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of blood
                     inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes,
                     it
                     flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining
                     its grasp until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon
                     the
                     head of the bed, over which the face of its master,, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still
                     in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having
                     deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped
                     about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the
                     furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized
                     first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then
                     that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong.<span class="hyperbole"> rigid with
                        horror<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank
                     aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home
                     --dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror,
                     all
                     solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon
                     the
                     staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with
                     the
                     fiendish jabberings of the brute.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped from the
                     chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door. It must have closed the
                     window as it passed through it. It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who
                     obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes. Le Bon was instantly
                     released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from
