            <h1>Figures of Speech</h1>
            <p>Figures of speech are literary devices that enhance language by conveying meaning in more imaginative or vivid ways, often beyond the literal interpretation of words. Edgar Allan Poe uses them in his stories to create intense atmospheres, deepen the emotional impact, and reveal the psychological states of his characters. By using these devices, Poe amplifies the themes of horror, madness, and guilt, drawing readers into the eerie worlds he constructs. These figures also help evoke strong emotional responses and add a lyrical, rhythmic quality to his writing. This table defines all of the figures of speech used in his short stories, and an example taken from his works.</p>
