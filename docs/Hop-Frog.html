      <h1>Hop-Frog</h1>
      <h2>(published 1849)</h2><img src="images/Hop_Frog.jpeg" alt="Picture of Hop Frog and a group of people"><div>
         <p>I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king  was. He seemed to live
            only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well,
            was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his seven ministers
            were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They all took after the king ,
            too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as
            inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something
            in
            fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine;
            but
            certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris. </p>
         <p>About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of
            wit, the king  troubled himself very little. He had an especial
            admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake
            of
            it. Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the
            'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better
            than verbal ones. </p>
         <p>At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not
            altogether gone out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental 'powers'
            still retain their 'fools,' who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were
            expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in
            consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.
            </p>
         <p>Our king , as a matter of course, retained his
            'fool.' The fact is, he required something in the way of folly -- if only to
            counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers -- not
            to mention himself.
            </p>
         <p>His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value was
            trebled in the eyes of the king , by the fact of his being also a dwarf and
            a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs
            would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at
            court
            than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But,
            as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases
            out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy -- so that it was no small source of
            self-gratulation with our king  that, in  Hop-Frog  (this
            was the fool's name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.
            </p>
         <p>I believe the name ' Hop-Frog ' was not that given to the dwarf by his
            sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several
            ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. In
            fact,  Hop-Frog  could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait
            -- something between a leap and a wriggle -- a movement that afforded illimitable
            amusement, and of course consolation, to the king , for
            (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of
            the head) the king , by his whole court, was accounted a capital
            figure.
            </p>
         <p>But although  Hop-Frog , through the
            distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road
            or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon
            his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to
            perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,
            or
            any thing else to climb. At such exercises he certainly
            much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.
            </p>
         <p>I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog
            originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that
            no person ever heard of -- a vast distance from the court of our king
            .
            Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although
            of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off
            from
            their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king
            , by one of his ever-victorious generals. </p>
         <p>Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose
            between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became sworn
            friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport,
            was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many
            services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf),
            was
            universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed
            to use
            it, whenever she could, for the benefit of Hop-Frog. </p>
         <p>On some grand state occasion -- I forgot what -- the king  determined
            to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred
            at
            our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta
            were sure to be called into play. 
            Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up
            pageants, suggesting novel chars, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that
            nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.
            </p>
         <p>The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been fitted up,
            under  Trippetta's eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give
            eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of expectation. As for costumes
            and chars, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such
            points. Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week,
            or
            even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere
            -- except in the case of the king  and his seven minsters. Why they
            hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably,
            they
            found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all events,
            time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for
            Trippetta and Hop-Frog.
            </p>
         <p>When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the
            king  they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his
            cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. He knew
            that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost
            to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king  loved his
            practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as
            the king  called it) 'to be merry.' </p>
         <p>"Come here, Hop-Frog," said he, as the jester and his
            friend entered the room;  "swallow this bumper to the health of your absent
            friends, [here Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of
            your invention. We want chars -- chars, man -- something novel -- out of the way.
            We
            are wearied with this everlasting sameness. Come, drink! the
            wine will brighten your wits." </p>
         <p>Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these
            advances from the king ; but the effort was too much. It happened to be the poor dwarf's
            birthday, and the command to drink to his
            'absent friends' forced the tears to his eyes.
            Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly,
            from the hand of the tyrant. </p>
         <p> "Ah! ha! ha!" roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained
            the beaker. --  "See what a glass of good wine can do! Why, your eyes are shining
            already!"
            </p>
         <p>Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than
            shone; for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was
            not more powerful than instantaneous. He placed the goblet nervously on the table,
            and looked round upon the company with a half -- insane stare. They all seemed
            highly amused at the success of the king's  'joke.' </p>
         <p> "And now to business," said the prime minister, a very fat man. </p>
         <p> "Yes," said the King; 
            "Come lend us your assistance. chars, my fine fellow; we stand
            in need of chars -- all of us -- ha! ha! ha!"
            and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven. </p>
         <p>Hop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly. </p>
         <p> "Come, come," said the king , impatiently, 
            "have you nothing to suggest?" </p>
         <p> "I am endeavoring to think of something novel," replied the dwarf,
            abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. </p>
         <p> "Endeavoring!" cried the tyrant, fiercely;  "what do you
            mean by that? Ah, I perceive. You are Sulky, and want more wine. Here, drink this!"
            and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely
            gazed at it, gasping for breath. </p>
         <p> "Drink, I say!" shouted the monster,  "or by the fiends-"
            </p>
         <p>The dwarf hesitated. The king  grew purple with rage. The courtiers smirked. Trippetta,
            pale as a corpse,
            advanced to the monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him
            to spare her friend.
            </p>
         <p>The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity. He
            seemed quite at a loss what to do or say -- how most becomingly to express his
            indignation. At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him,
            and
            threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face. </p>
         <p>The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her
            position at the foot of the table. </p>
         <p>There was a dead silence for about half a minute,
            during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard.
            It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound
            which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.
            </p>
         <p> "What -- what -- what are you making that noise for?" demanded
            the king , turning furiously to the dwarf. </p>
         <p>The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and
            looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant's face, merely ejaculated: </p>
         <p>
            "I -- I? How could it have been me?" 
            </p>
         <p>
            "The sound appeared to come from without,"
            observed one of the courtiers.  "I fancy it was the parrot at the window,
            whetting his bill upon his cage-wires." </p>
         <p> "True," replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the
            suggestion;  "but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the
            gritting of this vagabond's teeth." </p>
         <p>Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king  was too confirmed a joker to
            object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very
            repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine
            as
            desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very
            perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with spirit, into the
            plans for the masquerade. </p>
         <p> "I cannot tell what was the association of idea," observed he,
            very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life,  "but just after
            your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face -- just after your
            majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the
            window, there came into my mind a capital diversion -- one of my own country frolics
            -- often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether.
            Unfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and-" </p>
         <p> "Here we are!" cried the king , laughing at his acute
            discovery of the coincidence;  "eight to a fraction -- I and my seven ministers.
            Come! what is the diversion?" </p>
         <p> "We call it," replied the cripple, 
            "the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent
            sport if well enacted."
            </p>
         <p> "We will enact it," remarked the king , drawing
            himself up, and lowering his eyelids. </p>
         <p> "The beauty of the game," continued Hop-Frog, 
            "lies in the fright it occasions among the women." </p>
         <p> "Capital!" roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry. </p>
         <p> "I will equip you as ourang-outangs," proceeded the dwarf; 
            "leave all that to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of
            masqueraders will take you for real beasts -- and of course, they will be as much
            terrified as astonished." </p>
         <p> "Oh, this is exquisite!" exclaimed the king . 
            "Hop-Frog! I will make a man of you." </p>
         <p>
            "The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling.
            You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers. Your majesty cannot
            conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs,
            imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries,
            among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is
            inimitable!" 
            </p>
         <p> "It must be," said the king : and the council arose
            hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of
            Hop-Frog. </p>
         <p>His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective
            enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very
            rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by
            the
            dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their
            truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured. </p>
         <p>The king  and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting
            stockinet shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of
            the
            process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once
            overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that
            the
            hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by
            flax.
            A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A
            long
            chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king ,
            and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively,
            in the same manner. When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood
            as
            far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things
            appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters,
            at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day,
            by
            those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo. </p>
         <p>The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place,
            was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a
            single window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially
            designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain
            from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a
            counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed
            outside the cupola and over the roof.
            </p>
         <p>The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta's
            superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer
            judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion,
            the
            chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite
            impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of
            the
            guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected
            to
            keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional sconces
            were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet
            odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the
            wall
            -- some fifty or sixty altogether. </p>
         <p>The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's
            advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with
            masqueraders) before making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased
            striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together -- for the
            impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as
            they
            entered. </p>
         <p>The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of
            the king  with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of
            the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind
            in
            reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women swooned with affright;
            and
            had not the king  taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the
            saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was,
            a
            general rush was made for the doors; but the king  had ordered them to be
            locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had
            been
            deposited with him. </p>
         <p>While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own
            safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited
            crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn
            up
            on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked
            extremity came within three feet of the floor. </p>
         <p>Soon after this, the king  and his seven friends having reeled about
            the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course,
            in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who
            had
            followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took
            hold
            of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle
            diametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted
            the
            hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some
            unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out
            of
            reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close
            connection, and face to face. </p>
         <p>The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm;
            and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a
            loud
            shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes. </p>
         <p> "Leave them to me!" now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill
            voice making itself easily heard through all the din.  "Leave them to me. I fancy
            I know them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are."
            </p>
         <p>Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when,
            seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre
            of
            the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the king s head, and
            thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group
            of
            ourang-outangs, and still screaming:  "I shall soon find out who they are!"
            </p>
         <p>And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with
            laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently
            up
            for about thirty feet -- dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs,
            and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor.
            Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his
            relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the
            matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to
            discover who they were. </p>
         <p>So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead
            silence, of about a minute's duration, ensued. It was broken by just such a low, harsh,
            grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king  and his
            councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta. But,
            on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued.
            It
            came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he
            foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned
            countenances of the king  and his seven companions. </p>
         <p> "Ah, ha!" said at length the infuriated jester.  "Ah, ha! I
            begin to see who these people are now!" Here, pretending to scrutinize
            the king  more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which
            enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than
            half
            a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of
            the
            multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to
            render
            them the slightest assistance. </p>
         <p>At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb
            higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the
            crowd
            again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and
            once more spoke: </p>
         <p> "I now see distinctly." he said,  "what manner of people
            these maskers are. They are a great king  and his seven
            privy-councillors, -- a king  who does not scruple to strike a
            defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage. As for
            myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester -- and this is my last jest."
            </p>
         <p>Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered,
            the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance
            was
            complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and
            indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely
            to the
            ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light. </p>
         <p>It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon,
            had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they
            effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <p><span style="color: brown;">I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king  was.</span> He seemed to live only for joking.<span style="color: orange;"> To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well,
               was the surest road to his favor. </span>Thus it happened that his seven ministers
            were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They all took after the king , too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as
            inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something
            in
            fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine;
            but
            certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris. </p>
         <p><span style="color: brown;">About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of
               wit, the king  troubled himself very little. </span>He had an especial
            admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake
            of
            it. Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the
            'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better
            than verbal ones. </p>
         <p><span style="color: brown;">At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not
               altogether gone out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental 'powers'
               still retain their 'fools,' who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were
               expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in
               consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="color: brown;">Our king , as a matter of course, retained his
               'fool.' The fact is, he required something in the way of folly -- if only to
               counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers -- not
               to mention himself.</span>
            </p>
         <p>His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value was
            trebled in the eyes of the king , by the fact of his being also a dwarf and
            a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs
            would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at
            court
            than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.<span style="color: brown;"> But, as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases
               out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy -- so that it was no small source of
               self-gratulation with our king  that, in  Hop-Frog  (this
               was the fool's name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.</span>
            </p>
         <p>I believe the name ' Hop-Frog ' was not that given to the dwarf by his
            sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several
            ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. <span style="color: brown;">In
               fact,  Hop-Frog  could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait
               -- something between a leap and a wriggle -- a movement that afforded illimitable
               amusement, and of course consolation, to the king , for
               (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of
               the head) the king , by his whole court, was accounted a capital
               figure.</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="color: orange;">But although  Hop-Frog , through the
               distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road
               or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon
               his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to
               perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,
               or
               any thing else to climb. </span><span style="color: pink;">At such exercises he certainly
               much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.</span>
            </p>
         <p>I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog
            originally came. <span style="color: red;">It was from some barbarous region, however, that
               no person ever heard of -- a vast distance from the court of our king
               .</span>
            Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although
            of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off
            from
            their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king
            , by one of his ever-victorious generals. </p>
         <p>Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose
            between the two little captives.<span style="color: brown;"> Indeed, they soon became sworn
               friends.</span> Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport,
            was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many
            services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf),
            was
            universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed
            to use
            it, whenever she could, for the benefit of Hop-Frog. </p>
         <p>On some grand state occasion -- I forgot what -- the king  determined
            to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred
            at
            our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta
            were sure to be called into play. <span style="color: teal;">
               Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up
               pageants, suggesting novel chars, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that
               nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.</span>
            </p>
         <p>The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been fitted up,
            under  Trippetta's eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give
            eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of expectation. As for costumes
            and chars, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such
            points. Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week,
            or
            even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere
            -- except in the case of the king  and his seven minsters. Why they
            hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably,
            they
            found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. <span style="color: brown;">At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for
               Trippetta and Hop-Frog.
               </span></p>
         <p><span style="color: teal;">When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the
               king  they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his
               cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor</span>. He knew
            that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost
            to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. But the king  loved his
            practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as
            the king  called it) 'to be merry.' </p>
         <p>"Come here, Hop-Frog," said he, as the jester and his
            friend entered the room;  "swallow this bumper to the health of your absent
            friends, [here Hop-Frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of
            your invention. We want chars -- chars, man -- something novel -- out of the way.
            We
            are wearied with this everlasting sameness.<span style="color: brown;"> Come, drink! the
               wine will brighten your wits</span>." </p>
         <p>Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these
            advances from the king ; but the effort was too much. <span style="color: brown;">It happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his
               'absent friends' forced the tears to his eyes.</span>
            <span style="color: teal;">Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly,
               from the hand of the tyrant</span>. </p>
         <p> "Ah! ha! ha!" roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained
            the beaker. --  "See what a glass of good wine can do!<span style="color: orange;"> Why, your eyes are shining already!"</span>
            </p>
         <p><span style="color: orange;">Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than
               shone;</span><span style="color: teal;"> for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was
               not more powerful than instantaneous. He placed the goblet nervously on the table,
               and looked round upon the company with a half -- insane stare.</span> They all seemed
            highly amused at the success of the king's  'joke.' </p>
         <p> "And now to business," said the prime minister, a very fat man. </p>
         <p> "Yes," said the King; 
            <span style="color: brown;">"Come lend us your assistance. chars, my fine fellow; we stand
               in need of chars -- all of us -- ha! ha! ha!"</span>
            and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven. </p>
         <p>Hop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly. </p>
         <p> "Come, come," said the king , impatiently, 
            "have you nothing to suggest?" </p>
         <p> "I am endeavoring to think of something novel," replied the dwarf,
            abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. </p>
         <p> "Endeavoring!" cried the tyrant, fiercely;  "what do you
            mean by that? Ah, I perceive. You are Sulky, and want more wine. Here, drink this!"
            and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely
            gazed at it, gasping for breath. </p>
         <p> "Drink, I say!" shouted the monster,  "or by the fiends-"
            </p>
         <p>The dwarf hesitated. The king  grew purple with rage. <span style="color: pink;">The courtiers smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse,
               advanced to the monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him
               to spare her friend.</span>
            </p>
         <p>The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity. He
            seemed quite at a loss what to do or say -- how most becomingly to express his
            indignation. At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him,
            and
            threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face. </p>
         <p>The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her
            position at the foot of the table. </p>
         <p><span style="color: orange;">There was a dead silence for about half a minute,
               during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard.</span>
            <span style="color: teal;">It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound
               which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.</span>
            </p>
         <p> "What -- what -- what are you making that noise for?" demanded
            the king , turning furiously to the dwarf. </p>
         <p>The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and
            looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant's face, merely ejaculated: </p>
         <p>
             "I -- I? How could it have been me?" 
            </p>
         <p>
            <span style="color: brown;">"The sound appeared to come from without,"</span>
            observed one of the courtiers.  "I fancy it was the parrot at the window,
            whetting his bill upon his cage-wires." </p>
         <p> "True," replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the
            suggestion;  "but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the
            gritting of this vagabond's teeth." </p>
         <p>Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king  was too confirmed a joker to
            object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very
            repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine
            as
            desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very
            perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with spirit, into the
            plans for the masquerade. </p>
         <p> "I cannot tell what was the association of idea," observed he,
            very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life,  "but just after
            your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face -- just after your
            majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the
            window, there came into my mind a capital diversion -- one of my own country frolics
            -- often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether.
            Unfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and-" </p>
         <p> "Here we are!" cried the king , laughing at his acute
            discovery of the coincidence;  "eight to a fraction -- I and my seven ministers.
            Come! what is the diversion?" </p>
         <p> "We call it," replied the cripple, 
            <span style="color: brown;">"the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent
               sport if well enacted."</span>
            </p>
         <p> "We will enact it," remarked the king , drawing
            himself up, and lowering his eyelids. </p>
         <p> "The beauty of the game," continued Hop-Frog, 
            "lies in the fright it occasions among the women." </p>
         <p> "Capital!" roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry. </p>
         <p> "I will equip you as ourang-outangs," proceeded the dwarf; 
            "leave all that to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of
            masqueraders will take you for real beasts -- and of course, they will be as much
            terrified as astonished." </p>
         <p> "Oh, this is exquisite!" exclaimed the king . 
            "Hop-Frog! I will make a man of you." </p>
         <p>
             "The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling.
            You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers. Your majesty cannot
            conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs,
            imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries,
            among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is
            inimitable!" 
            </p>
         <p> "It must be," said the king : and the council arose
            hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of
            Hop-Frog. </p>
         <p>His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective
            enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very
            rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by
            the
            dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their
            truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured. </p>
         <p>The king  and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting
            stockinet shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of
            the
            process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once
            overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that
            the
            hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by
            flax.
            A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A
            long
            chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king ,
            and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively,
            in the same manner. When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood
            as
            far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things
            appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters,
            at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day,
            by
            those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo. </p>
         <p><span style="color: teal;">The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place,
               was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a
               single window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially
               designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain
               from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a
               counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed
               outside the cupola and over the roof.</span>
            </p>
         <p>The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta's
            superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer
            judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion,
            the
            chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite
            impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of
            the
            guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected
            to
            keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional sconces
            were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet
            odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the
            wall
            -- some fifty or sixty altogether. </p>
         <p><span style="color: teal;">The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's
               advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with
               masqueraders) before making their appearance.</span> No sooner had the clock ceased
            striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together -- for the
            impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as
            they
            entered. </p>
         <p>The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of
            the king  with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of
            the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind
            in
            reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women swooned with affright;
            and
            had not the king  taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the
            saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was,
            a
            general rush was made for the doors; but the king  had ordered them to be
            locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had
            been
            deposited with him. </p>
         <p>While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own
            safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited
            crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn
            up
            on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked
            extremity came within three feet of the floor. </p>
         <p>Soon after this, the king  and his seven friends having reeled about
            the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course,
            in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who
            had
            followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took
            hold
            of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle
            diametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted
            the
            hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some
            unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out
            of
            reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close
            connection, and face to face. </p>
         <p>The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm;
            and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a
            loud
            shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes. </p>
         <p> "Leave them to me!" now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill
            voice making itself easily heard through all the din.  "Leave them to me. I fancy
            I know them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are."
            </p>
         <p>Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when,
            seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre
            of
            the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the king s head, and
            thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group
            of
            ourang-outangs, and still screaming:  "I shall soon find out who they are!"
            </p>
         <p>And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with
            laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently
            up
            for about thirty feet -- dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs,
            and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor.
            Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his
            relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the
            matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to
            discover who they were. </p>
         <p>So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead
            silence, of about a minute's duration, ensued. It was broken by just such a low, harsh,
            grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king  and his
            councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta. But,
            on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued.
            It
            came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he
            foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned
            countenances of the king  and his seven companions. </p>
         <p> "Ah, ha!" said at length the infuriated jester.  "Ah, ha! I
            begin to see who these people are now!" Here, pretending to scrutinize
            the king  more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which
            enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than
            half
            a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of
            the
            multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to
            render
            them the slightest assistance. </p>
         <p>At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb
            higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the
            crowd
            again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and
            once more spoke: </p>
         <p> "I now see distinctly." he said,  "what manner of people
            these maskers are. They are a great king  and his seven
            privy-councillors, -- a king  who does not scruple to strike a
            defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage. As for
            myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester -- and this is my last jest."
            </p>
         <p>Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered,
            the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance
            was
            complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and
            indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely
            to the
            ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light. </p>
         <p>It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon,
            had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they
            effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again. </p>
