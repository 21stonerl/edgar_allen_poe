                  <p> He seemed to live only for joking.Thus it happened that his seven ministers
                     were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They all took after the, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as
                     inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something
                     in
                     fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine;
                     but
                     certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris. <span class="metaphor">I NEVER knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king  was.<span class="metaphor"></span></span><span class="personification"> To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well,
                        was the surest road to his favor. </span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>He had an especial
                     admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake
                     of
                     it. Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais' 'Gargantua' to the
                     'Zadig' of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better
                     than verbal ones. <span class="metaphor">About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghost' of
                        wit, the king  troubled himself very little. </span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="metaphor">At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not
                        altogether gone out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental 'powers'
                        still retain their 'fools,' who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were
                        expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in
                        consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="metaphor">Our king , as a matter of course, retained his
                        'fool.' The fact is, he required something in the way of folly -- if only to
                        counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers -- not
                        to mention himself.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value was
                     trebled in the eyes of the, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and
                     a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs
                     would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at
                     court
                     than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.
                     <span class="metaphor"> But, as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases
                        out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy -- so that it was no small source of
                        self-gratulation with our king  that, in  Hop-Frog  (this
                        was the fool's name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I believe the name '' was not that given to the dwarf by his
                     sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several
                     ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. 
                     <span class="metaphor">In
                        fact,  Hop-Frog  could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait
                        -- something between a leap and a wriggle -- a movement that afforded illimitable
                        amusement, and of course consolation, to the king , for
                        (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of
                        the head) the king , by his whole court, was accounted a capital
                        figure.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="personification">But although  Hop-Frog , through the
                        distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road
                        or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon
                        his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to
                        perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question,
                        or
                        any thing else to climb. </span><span class="simile">At such exercises he certainly
                        much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.<span class="simile"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>I am not able to say, with precision, from what country 
                     originally came. 
                     , and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although
                     of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off
                     from
                     their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the, by one of his ever-victorious generals. <span class="hyperbole">It was from some barbarous region, however, that
                        no person ever heard of -- a vast distance from the court of our king
                        .<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose
                     between the two little captives., who, although he made a great deal of sport,
                     was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render  many
                     services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf),
                     was
                     universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed
                     to use
                     it, whenever she could, for the benefit of . <span class="metaphor"> Indeed, they soon became sworn
                        friends.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>On some grand state occasion -- I forgot what -- the determined
                     to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred
                     at
                     our court, then the talents, both of and 
                     were sure to be called into play. 
                     <span class="imagery">
                        Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up
                        pageants, suggesting novel chars, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that
                        nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The night appointed for the fete had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been fitted up,
                     under  eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give
                     eclat to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of expectation. As for costumes
                     and chars, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such
                     points. Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week,
                     or
                     even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere
                     -- except in the case of the and his seven minsters. Why they
                     hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably,
                     they
                     found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. <span class="metaphor">At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for
                        Trippetta and Hop-Frog.
                        <span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>. He knew
                     that  was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost
                     to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. But the loved his
                     practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing  to drink and (as
                     the called it) 'to be merry.' <span class="imagery">When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the
                        king  they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his
                        cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> said he, as the jester and his
                     friend entered the room; </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these
                     advances from the; but the effort was too much. 
                     . <span class="metaphor">It happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his
                        'absent friends' forced the tears to his eyes.<span class="metaphor"></span></span><span class="imagery">Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly,
                        from the hand of the tyrant<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained
                     the beaker. -- </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> They all seemed
                     highly amused at the success of the 'joke.' <span class="personification">Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than
                        shone;<span class="personification"></span></span><span class="imagery"> for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was
                        not more powerful than instantaneous. He placed the goblet nervously on the table,
                        and looked round upon the company with a half -- insane stare.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>said the prime minister, a very fat man. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>said the ; and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>said the, impatiently, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>replied the dwarf,
                     abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>cried the tyrant, fiercely; and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely
                     gazed at it, gasping for breath. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>shouted the monster, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The dwarf hesitated. The grew purple with rage. 
                     <span class="simile">The courtiers smirked. Trippetta, pale as a corpse,
                        advanced to the monarch's seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him
                        to spare her friend.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity. He
                     seemed quite at a loss what to do or say -- how most becomingly to express his
                     indignation. At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him,
                     and
                     threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her
                     position at the foot of the table. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     
                     <span class="personification">There was a dead silence for about half a minute,
                        during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard.<span class="personification"></span></span><span class="imagery">It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound
                        which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>

                  <p>demanded
                     the, turning furiously to the dwarf. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and
                     looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant's face, merely ejaculated: </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>observed one of the courtiers. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the
                     suggestion; </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the was too confirmed a joker to
                     object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very
                     repulsive teeth. Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine
                     as
                     desired. The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very
                     perceptible ill effect,  entered at once, and with spirit, into the
                     plans for the masquerade. </p>

               <p>
                  <p>observed he,
                     very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>cried the, laughing at his acute
                     discovery of the coincidence; </p>

                  <p>proceeded the dwarf; </p>

               <p>
                  <p>exclaimed the. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>said the: and the council arose
                     hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of
                     . </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective
                     enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very
                     rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by
                     the
                     dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their
                     truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting
                     stockinet shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of
                     the
                     process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once
                     overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that
                     the
                     hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by
                     flax.
                     A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A
                     long
                     chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the,
                     and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively,
                     in the same manner. When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood
                     as
                     far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things
                     appear natural,  passed the residue of the chain in two diameters,
                     at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day,
                     by
                     those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     <span class="imagery">The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place,
                        was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a
                        single window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially
                        designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain
                        from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a
                        counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed
                        outside the cupola and over the roof.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The arrangements of the room had been left to 
                     superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer
                     judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion,
                     the
                     chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite
                     impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of
                     the
                     guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected
                     to
                     keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional sconces
                     were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet
                     odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the
                     wall
                     -- some fifty or sixty altogether. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> No sooner had the clock ceased
                     striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together -- for the
                     impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as
                     they
                     entered. <span class="imagery">The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's
                        advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with
                        masqueraders) before making their appearance.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of
                     the with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of
                     the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind
                     in
                     reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women swooned with affright;
                     and
                     had not the taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the
                     saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was,
                     a
                     general rush was made for the doors; but the had ordered them to be
                     locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had
                     been
                     deposited with him. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own
                     safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited
                     crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn
                     up
                     on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked
                     extremity came within three feet of the floor. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Soon after this, the and his seven friends having reeled about
                     the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course,
                     in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who
                     had
                     followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took
                     hold
                     of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle
                     diametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted
                     the
                     hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some
                     unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out
                     of
                     reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close
                     connection, and face to face. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm;
                     and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a
                     loud
                     shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>now screamed , his shrill
                     voice making itself easily heard through all the din. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when,
                     seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre
                     of
                     the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon thes head, and
                     thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group
                     of
                     ourang-outangs, and still screaming: </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with
                     laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently
                     up
                     for about thirty feet -- dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs,
                     and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor.
                     , clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his
                     relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the
                     matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to
                     discover who they were. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead
                     silence, of about a minute's duration, ensued. It was broken by just such a low, harsh,
                     grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the and his
                     councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of . But,
                     on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued.
                     It
                     came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he
                     foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned
                     countenances of the and his seven companions. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>said at length the infuriated jester. Here, pretending to scrutinize
                     the more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which
                     enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than
                     half
                     a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of
                     the
                     multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to
                     render
                     them the slightest assistance. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb
                     higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the
                     crowd
                     again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and
                     once more spoke: </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>he said, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered,
                     the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance
                     was
                     complete. The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and
                     indistinguishable mass. The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely
                     to the
                     ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light. </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It is supposed that , stationed on the roof of the saloon,
                     had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they
                     effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again. </p>
