         "Listen to me," said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head. "There is a spot
         upon this accursed earth which thou hast never yet beheld And if by any chance thou
         hast
         beheld it, it must have been in one of those vigorous dreams which come like the Simoon
         upon
         the brain of the sleeper who hath lain down to sleep among the forbidden sunbeams
         --among
         the sunbeams, I say, which slide from off the solemn columns of the melancholy temples
         in
         the wilderness. The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders
         of
         the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.
         
         "The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue --and they flow not onwards
         to
         the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous
         and convulsive motion. For many miles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a
         pale
         desert of gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and
         stretch
         towards the heaven their long ghastly necks, and nod to and fro their everlasting
         heads. And
         there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of
         subterrene water. And they sigh one unto the other.
         
         "But there is a boundary to their realm --the boundary of the dark, horrible, lofty
         forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually.
         But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally
         hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,
         one by
         one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing
         in
         perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the grey clouds rush
         westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon.
         But
         there is no wind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there
         is
         neither quiet nor silence.
         
         "It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, having fallen, it
         was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies, and the rain fell upon
         my head
         --and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation.
         
         "And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was crimson in
         color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge grey rock which stood by the shore of the river,
         and
         was litten by the light of the moon. And the rock was grey, and ghastly, and tall,
         --and the
         rock was grey. Upon its front were chars engraven in the stone; and I walked through
         the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I might read the
         chars upon the stone. But I could not decypher the chars. And I was going back
         into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again
         upon
         the rock, and upon the chars --and the chars were DESOLATION.
         
         "And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock, and I hid
         myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the actions of the man. And the
         man was
         tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the
         toga of
         old Rome. And the outlines of his figure were indistinct --but his features were the
         features of a Deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and of the moon,
         and of
         the dew, had left uncovered the features of his face. And his brow was lofty with
         thought,
         and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables
         of
         sorrow, and weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude. And
         the moon
         shone upon his face, and upon the features of his face, and oh! they were more beautiful
         than the airy dreams which hovered about the souls of the daughters of Delos!
         
         "And the man sat down upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and looked
         out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into
         the tall
         primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And
         I lay
         close within shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man
         trembled in the solitude --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
         
         "And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon the dreary
         river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the
         water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies, and of the murmur
         that
         came up from among them. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions
         of the
         man. And the man trembled in the solitude --but the night waned and he sat upon the
         rock.
         
         "Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in among the
         wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens
         in the
         recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth,
         unto
         the foot of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay
         close
         within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the
         solitude
         --but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.
         
         "Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful tempest
         gathered in the heaven where before there had been no wind. And the heaven became
         livid with
         the violence of the tempest --and the rain beat upon the head of the man --and the
         floods of
         the river came down --and the river was tormented into foam --and the water-lilies
         shrieked
         within their beds --and the forest crumbled before the wind --and the thunder rolled,
         --and
         the lightning fell --and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close within
         my covert
         and observed the actions of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude -- but the
         night
         waned and he sat upon the rock.
         
         "Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and the lilies,
         and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the
         water-lilies. And they became accursed and were still. And the moon ceased to totter
         in its
         pathway up the heaven --and the thunder died away --and the lightning did not flash
         --and
         the clouds hung motionless --and the waters sunk to their level and remained --and
         the trees
         ceased to rock --and the water-lilies sighed no more --and the murmur was heard no
         longer
         from among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And
         I
         looked upon the chars of the rock, and they were changed --and the chars were
         SILENCE.
         
         "And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance was wan with
         terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand, and stood forth upon the
         rock, and
         listened. But there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the chars
         upon the rock were SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled
         afar
         off, and I beheld him no more."
