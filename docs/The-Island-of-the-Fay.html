                  <p>," says Marmontel, in those 
                     which in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling  as if in  --
                     
                      No more than any other talent, is that for music
                     susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its
                     exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which
                     may
                     be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the raconteur has either failed to
                     entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point,
                     is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most
                     thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition, in this form,
                     will
                     be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual
                     uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps
                     only one -- which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of
                     seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery.
                     In
                     truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude
                     behold that glory. To me, at least, the presence -- not of human life only, but of
                     life
                     in any other form than that of the  -- is a stain upon the landscape --  I love, indeed, to

                        inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is
                        the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought
                        is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in
                        immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the
                        animalculae which infest the brain -- a being which we, in consequence, regard as
                        purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus
                        regard us.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>

               <p>
                  <p>* Moraux is here derived from moeurs, and its meaning is
                      or more strictly  Our
                     telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand --
                     notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood -- that space, and
                     therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The
                     cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without
                     collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies.  And since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a
                     principle -- indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the
                     operations of Deity, -- it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions
                     of
                     the minute, where we daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As
                     we
                     find  may we not analogically suppose
                     in the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all within
                     the
                     Spirit Divine? In short, we are  in believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to
                     be of more moment in the universe than that vast "clod of the valley" which he tills
                     and
                     contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does
                     not behold it in operation.*<span class="imagery">The forms of
                        those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest
                        possible amount of matter; -- while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to
                        accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces
                        otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God,
                        that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill
                        it.</span><span class="symbolism">cycle within cycle without end, -- yet all revolving around

                     in allusion to the well-known work of , that,  The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a thing
                     that does not exist.<span class="imagery">These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
                        among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a tinge of what
                        the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My wanderings amid such scenes
                        have been many, and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest with which
                        I
                        have strayed through many a dim, deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of
                        many a bright lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have
                        strayed and gazed alone.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of mountain
                     locked within mountain, and  -- that I chanced upon a certain rivulet and
                     island. <span class="personification">sad rivers and melancholy tarn
                        writhing or sleeping within all<span class="personification"></span></span><span class="imagery">I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw
                        myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might
                        doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only should I look upon it --
                        such was the char of phantasm which it wore.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p><span class="imagery">On all sides -- save to the west, where the sun was about
                        sinking -- arose the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned
                        sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no exit
                        from its prison, but to be absorbed by the
                        deep green foliage of the trees to the east -- while in the opposite quarter (so it
                        appeared to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly
                        and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the
                        sunset fountains of the sky.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> That each seemed pendulous in air -- so
                     mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to say at what point
                     upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion began. My position enabled
                     me to
                     include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet; and
                     I
                     observed a singularly-marked difference in their aspects.  There seemed a deep sense of life and joy
                     about all; and although no airs blew from out the heavens, *<span class="imagery">About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in,
                        one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the stream.

                        was all one radiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes
                        of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short,
                        springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe, mirthful,
                        erect -- bright, slender, and graceful, -- of eastern figure and foliage, with bark
                        smooth, glossy, and parti-colored.</span><span class="hyperbole">yet
                        every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable
                        butterflies, that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.<span class="hyperbole"></span></span></p>

                      I
                     fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself
                     sullenly from the , and thus
                     became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees,
                     taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed.<span class="imagery">The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest
                        shade. A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things.</span><span class="personification">The trees were dark in color,and mournful in form and
                        attitude, wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed
                        ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death.The grass wore the deep tint of the
                        cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and thither among
                        it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and not very long, that had
                        the aspect of graves, but were not; although over and all about them the rue and the
                        rosemary clambered.<span class="personification"></span></span><span class="imagery">The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to
                        bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness.<span class="imagery"></span></span><span class="personification">trunk that gave it birth<span class="personification"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I lost myself
                     forthwith in revery. "If ever island were enchanted," said I to myself, "this is it.
                     This is the haunt of the few gentle  who remain from the wreck of the
                     race. Are these green tombs theirs? -- or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind
                     yield up their own? In dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering
                     unto
                     , little by little, their existence, as these trees render up
                     shadow after shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting
                     tree
                     is to the water that imbibes its shade, , may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs

                     stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
                     oar.
                     While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed indicative
                     of
                     joy -- but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along,
                     and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. <span class="imagery">while the sun sank
                        rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
                        upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the sycamore-flakes
                        which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a quick imagination might have
                        converted into any thing it pleased, while I thus mused, it appeared to me that the
                        form of one of those very Fays about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly
                        into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>

                     the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.  But at length when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now the , went disconsolately with her
                     boat into the region of the ebony flood, and that she issued thence at all I cannot
                     say,
                     for darkness fell over an things and I beheld her magical figure no more.<span class="imagery">She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which
                        deepened momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
                        became absorbed into its blackness.<span class="imagery"></span></span><span class="imagery"> And again and again
                        she made the circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and

                        feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each passage into the gloom
                        there fell from her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more
