               <p>
                  <p> Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that the
                     extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It would have been a miracle
                     had it
                     not -- especially under the circumstances. Through the desire of all parties concerned,
                     to
                     keep the affair from the public, at least for the present, or until we had farther
                     opportunities for investigation -- through our endeavors to effect this -- a garbled
                     or
                     exaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of many unpleasant
                     misrepresentations; and, very naturally, of a great deal of disbelief.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts -- as far as I comprehend them
                     myself. They are, succinctly, these:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to the subject
                     of
                     Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago, it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in
                     the series
                     of experiments made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable
                     omission: no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to
                     be seen,
                     first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility
                     to the
                     magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was impaired or increased
                     by the
                     condition; thirdly, to what extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of
                     Death might
                     be arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained, but these most
                     excited
                     my curiosity -- the last in especial, from the immensely important character of its
                     consequences.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these particulars,
                     I
                     was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of
                     the
                     "Bibliotheca Forensica," and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the
                     Polish
                     versions of "Wallenstein" and"Gargantua." M. Valdemar, who has resided principally
                     at Harlem,
                     N. Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness
                     of
                     his person -- his lower limbs much resembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for
                     the
                     whiteness of his whiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair -- the
                     latter, in
                     consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament was markedly
                     nervous,
                     and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions
                     I had put
                     him to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his
                     peculiar
                     constitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no period positively,
                     or
                     thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could accomplish with
                     him
                     nothing to be relied upon. I always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered
                     state of his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him,
                     his
                     physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to
                     speak
                     calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of course very
                     natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the steady philosophy of the man
                     too well
                     to apprehend any scruples from him; and he had no relatives in America who would be
                     likely to
                     interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise, his interest
                     seemed
                     vividly excited. I say to my surprise; for, although he had always yielded his person
                     freely
                     to my experiments, he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what I
                     did. His
                     disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to
                     the epoch
                     of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged between us that he would
                     send for me
                     about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his
                     decease.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M. Valdemar himself,
                     the subjoined note:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in fifteen minutes
                     more I was in the dying man's chamber. I had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled
                     by
                     the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him.  His expectoration was
                     excessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very
                     remarkable
                     manner, both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength. He spoke
                     with
                     distinctness -- took some palliative medicines without aid -- and, when I entered
                     the room,
                     was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed
                     by pillows.
                     Doctors D___ and F___ were in attendance.<span class="imagery">His
                        face wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so
                        extreme,
                        that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones.<span class="imagery"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> After pressing Valdemar's hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and obtained from them
                     a
                     minute account of the patient's condition. The left lung had been for eighteen months
                     in a
                     semi-osseous or cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all
                     purposes of
                     vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, if not thoroughly,
                     ossified,
                     while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into another.
                     Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to the
                     ribs had
                     taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date.
                     The
                     ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no sign of it had discovered
                     a month
                     before, and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days. Independently
                     of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta; but on this point
                     the
                     osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both
                     physicians
                     that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday.) It was then seven
                     o'clock on
                     Saturday evening.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> On quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself, Doctors D___
                     and
                     F___ had bidden him a final farewell. It had not been their intention to return; but,
                     at my
                     request, they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> When they had gone, I spoke freely with  on
                     the subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the
                     experiment
                     proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made,
                     and urged
                     me to commence it at once. A male and a female nurse were in attendance; but I did
                     not feel
                     myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable
                     witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove. I therefore
                     postponed
                     operations until about eight the next night, when the arrival of a medical student,
                     with whom
                     I had some acquaintance, (,) relieved me from farther
                     embarrassment. It had been my design, originally, to wait for the physicians; but
                     I was
                     induced to proceed, first, by the urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly,
                     by my
                     conviction that I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                      was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all
                     that occurred; and it is from his memoranda that what I now have to relate is, for
                     the most
                     part, either condensed or copied verbatim.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I begged him
                     to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L___l, whether he (M. Valdemar,) was entirely
                     willing that I should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> He replied feebly, yet quite audibly,  -- adding immediately afterwards, </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found most effectual
                     in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand
                     across
                     his forehead; but although I exerted all my powers, no farther perceptible effect
                     was induced
                     until some minutes after ten o'clock, when Doctors D___ and F___ called, according
                     to
                     appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I designed, and as they opposed
                     no
                     objection, saying that the patient was already in the death agony, I proceeded without
                     hesitation -- exchanging, however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing
                     my gaze
                     entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous, and at
                     intervals of half a minute.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the expiration of
                     this period, however, a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the
                     dying man,
                     and the stertorous breathing ceased -- that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer
                     apparent; the intervals were undiminished. The patient's extremities were of an icy
                     coldness.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> At five minutes before eleven, I perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric
                     influence.  was changed for that
                     expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of sleep-waking,
                     and which it is quite impossible to mistake. With a few rapid lateral passes I made
                     the lids
                     quiver, as in incipient sleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was
                     not
                     satisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulations vigorously, and , until I had , after placing them
                     in a seemingly easy position. <span class="imagery">The glassy roll of the eye<span class="imagery"></span></span><span class="personification">with the fullest exertion of the will<span class="personification"></span></span><span class="hyperbole">completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer<span class="hyperbole"></span></span><span class="imagery">The legs were at full length; the arms were
                        nearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loins. The head
                        was very
                        slightly elevated.</span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested the gentlemen
                     present to examine  condition. After a few experiments, they
                     admitted him to be in an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance. The curiosity
                     of both the
                     physicians was greatly excited.  resolved at once to remain with the
                     patient all night, while Dr. F___ took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.
                     Mr. L___l
                     and the nurses remained.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning,
                     when I approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when Dr. F___
                     went away
                     -- that is to say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing
                     was
                     gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the lips;)
                     the eyes
                     were closed naturally; and  Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of death.<span class="simile">the limbs were as rigid and as cold as
                        marble.<span class="simile"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm
                     into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently to and fro above his person.
                     In such
                     experiments with this patient, I had never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly
                     I had
                     little thought of succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although
                     feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to hazard a
                     few words
                     of conversation.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                      I said,  He made no answer, but I perceived a
                     tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the question, again and again.
                     At its
                     third repetition, his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering; the eye-lids
                     unclosed themselves so far as to display a white line of a ball; the lips moved sluggishly,
                     and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm, as before,
                     obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-waker again:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and nothing more was
                     said or done until the arrival of Dr. F___, who came a little before sunrise, and
                     expressed
                     unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive. After feeling the pulse
                     and
                     applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again.
                     I did so,
                     saying:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the interval the
                     dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak. At my fourth repetition of
                     the
                     question, he said very faintly, almost inaudibly:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that M. Valdemar
                     should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition,
                     until
                     death should supervene -- and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place within
                     a few
                     minutes. I concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my previous
                     question.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the sleep-waker.
                     The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin
                     generally
                     assumed a cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the
                     circular
                     hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek,
                     went out
                     at once. I use this expression, because the suddenness of their departure put me in
                     mind of
                     nothing so much as the extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper
                     lip, at
                     the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had previously covered
                     completely;
                     while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended,
                     and
                     disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member
                     of the
                     party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous beyond
                     conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general
                     shrinking back from the region of the bed.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader will
                     be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business, however, simply to proceed.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and concluding
                     him
                     to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory
                     motion
                     was observable in the tongue. This continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration
                     of this
                     period, there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice -- such as it
                     would be
                     madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or three epithets which
                     might be
                     considered as applicable to it in part; I might say, for example, that the sound was
                     harsh,
                     and broken and hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason
                     that no
                     similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two particulars,
                     nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as characteristic
                     of the intonation -- as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity.
                     In the
                     first place, the voice seemed to reach our ears -- at least mine -- from a vast distance,
                     or
                      In the second place, it
                     impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself comprehended)
                     as
                     gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch.<span class="metaphor">from some deep cavern within the earth.<span class="metaphor"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I have spoken both of "sound"and of "voice." I mean to say that the sound was one
                     of
                     distinct -- of even wonderfully, thrillingly distinct -- syllabification. M. Valdemar
                     spoke --
                     obviously in reply to the question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I
                     had asked
                     him, it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the unutterable,
                     shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were so well calculated to
                     convey. Mr.
                     L___l (the student) swooned. The nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not
                     be induced
                     to return. My own impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader.
                     For
                     nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently -- without the utterance of a word --
                     in
                     endeavors to revive Mr. L___l. When he came to himself, we addressed ourselves again
                     to an
                     investigation of M. Valdemar's condition.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the exception that
                     the
                     mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An attempt to draw blood from the
                     arm
                     failed. I should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my will. I
                     endeavored
                     in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication, indeed,
                     of the
                     mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue, whenever
                     I
                     addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had
                     no longer
                     sufficient volition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed
                     utterly
                     insensible -- although I endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric
                     rapport
                     with him. I believe that I have now related all that is necessary to an understanding
                     of the
                     sleep-waker's state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock
                     I left the
                     house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L___l.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition remained
                     precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the propriety and feasibility
                     of
                     awakening him; but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would
                     be served
                     by so doing. It was evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death)
                     had been
                     arrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar
                     would
                     be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy dissolution.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> From this period until the close of last week -- an interval of nearly seven months
                     -- we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house, accompanied, now and then,
                     by
                     medical and other friends. All this time the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have
                     last
                     described him. The nurses' attentions were continual.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening,
                     or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter
                     experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles -- to so
                     much of what
                     I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular feeling.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I made use of
                     the
                     customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful. The first indication of revival
                     was
                     afforded by a partial descent of the iris. It was observed, as especially remarkable,
                     that
                     this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish
                     ichor
                     (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient's arm, as
                     heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F___ then intimated a desire to have
                     me put a
                     question. I did so, as follows:</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; 
                     (although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length the same hideous
                     voice
                     which I have already described, broke forth:<span class="personification">the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth<span class="personification"></span></span></p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p>
                     </p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to do. At first
                     I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failing in this through total abeyance
                     of
                     the will, I retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt
                     I soon
                     saw that I should be successful -- or at least I soon fancied that my success would
                     be
                     complete -- and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human being could
                     have been prepared.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <p> As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of  absolutely bursting from the tongue and
                     not from the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once -- within the space of
                     a single
                     minute, or even less, shrunk -- crumbled -- absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
                     Upon the
                     bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome -- of
                     detestable
                     putridity. </p>
