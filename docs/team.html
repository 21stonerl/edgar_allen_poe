            Commentary/Process
            
            Your website must include commentary, on one or more pages, which should cover the following:
            
            -Who the members of the team are (give credit also to your TA if you have one!)
            
            -What you set out to achieve (research question)
            
            -How you worked to achieve that (selecting texts, xml markup, xslt/xquery processing, css, presentation layout, and so on)
            
            -Some decisions you had to make along the way, and why you chose the things you did
            
            -Some suggestions for what else could be done with your code or discoveries</p>
