         <h3>How we worked to achieve website (selecting texts, XML markup, XSLT, CSS, and layout):</h3>
        <ol> 
<li>To build the Edgar Allan Poe website, we first selected a collection of Poe’s short stories as the foundational texts for the project. These stories were then converted into XML, allowing for easy extraction of key elements like figures of speech, themes, and characters. Each short story was tagged with XML markup to categorize and identify relevant sections of the text, such as dialogue, paragraphs, and figures of speech. This made it easier to extract specific details and organize the content on the site.</li>
            
<li>We then used XSLT to process the XML data. XSLT allowed us to convert the structured XML into HTML for display on the website. We used XPath to extract the specific figures of speech, themes, and character data from each story.</li>
            
<li>For styling the website, we used CSS to ensure the pages were visually appealing and user-friendly. We chose a clean, minimalistic design that allowed the content to shine without distraction with a bit of a spooky element with the red background, and photo choices. The layout was structured to showcase the key elements — a navigation bar for easy access to various sections, a main content area for the stories, and tables for displaying the themes, characters, and figures of speech. We also used responsive design to ensure that the website would be accessible on a variety of screen sizes.</li></ol>
